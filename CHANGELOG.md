# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.85] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Bump the deployment package version after the Warp Team cleanup, message, and color-lane UX work so the next npm release has a fresh patch version.

## [0.6.84] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Improve Warp Team sessions with cleanup-aware `watch`/`lane` follow loops, bounded `sks team message` inter-agent communication, terminal titles, and stronger color-coded lane banners.

## [0.6.83] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Replace the SKS CLI runtime from cmux to Warp Launch Configurations, including `sks`, `sks warp`, `sks --mad`, dependency checks, doctor/bootstrap readiness, Team live lanes, generated quick references, and README usage.
- Remove cmux runtime support and its socket/workspace control path from the source tree.

## [0.6.81] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Require package pipeline UI/browser verification and visual inspection evidence to use Codex Computer Use only, explicitly rejecting Playwright, Chrome MCP, Browser Use, Selenium, Puppeteer, and other browser automation as substitutes.

## [0.6.80] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- Stop repeating the SKS update prompt after the installed `sks` binary is already at the npm latest version, and clear stale pending update offers before accepting another update response.

## [0.6.79] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Require Codex Computer Use-only evidence for UI-level QA/E2E verification, explicitly rejecting Chrome MCP, Browser Use, Playwright, and other browser automation as UI verification substitutes.

## [0.6.78] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Add `sks harness fixture|review` and `harness-growth-report.json` for deliberate forgetting fixtures, skill card metadata, harness experiment schema, permission profiles, MultiAgentV2 defaults, Cmux cockpit view coverage, and tool-error taxonomy.
- Record failed tool calls into `tool-errors.jsonl` with InvalidArguments, UnexpectedEnvironment, ProviderError, UserAborted, Timeout, PermissionDenied, NetworkDenied, ResourceExhausted, Conflict, or Unknown classification; Unknown is marked as a harness bug.

### Changed

- Tighten the ambiguity stop gate so a clarification-only final must visibly include the `Required questions` block and slot ids instead of passing on vague “I need decisions” wording.
- Expand Team dashboard panes to the requested Mission/Goal, Agent Grid, MultiAgentV2, Work Order Ledger, Memory Health, Forget Queue, Mistake Immunity, Tool Reliability, Harness Experiments, Dogfood Evidence, Code Structure, and statusline/title cockpit surfaces.
- Extend Goal workflow artifacts with checkpoints, resume context, clear policy, and structured `/goal` continuation metadata.

## [0.6.77] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Make `sks team` open a tmux-style cmux orchestration workspace with a live mission overview pane plus split per-agent lanes.
- Render `sks team watch` as a readable live cockpit instead of raw transcript JSON by default, with `--raw` preserving the old tail output.
- Color-code and rename cmux Team lanes by role, expose role status badges, and collapse agent panes back to the overview through `sks team cleanup-cmux` or the `session_cleanup` live event.
- Repair external cmux socket launch by restarting cmux with a non-persistent `CMUX_SOCKET_MODE=allowAll` fallback when default `cmuxOnly` control rejects SKS with `Broken pipe`.

## [0.6.76] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Add TriWiki memory-governor sweep reports with ADD/UPDATE/CONSOLIDATE/DEMOTE/SOFT_FORGET/ARCHIVE/HARD_DELETE/NOOP/PROMOTE operations and bounded retrieval budgets.
- Add `sks wiki sweep` to emit memory hygiene, Skill Forge, Mistake Memory, and code-structure mission artifacts.
- Add `sks code-structure scan` and `code-structure-report.json` for 1000/2000/3000-line structure gates and split-review exceptions.

### Changed

- Team preparation now writes memory sweep, skill forge, mistake-memory, and code-structure reports before dashboard rendering.
- Team dashboard state now includes Memory Attention, Forget Queue, Skill Autopilot, Mistake Immunity, and Code Structure panes.
- Split maintenance-heavy CLI handlers into `src/cli/maintenance-commands.mjs`, bringing `src/cli/main.mjs` below the 3,000-line split-required review gate.

## [0.6.75] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Add `$Goal` and `sks goal create|pause|resume|clear|status` as the SKS bridge to Codex native persisted `/goal` workflows.
- Add `goal-workflow.json` and `goal-bridge.md` mission artifacts so pipeline runs record the native `/goal` control contract.

### Changed

- Replace the user-facing Ralph route, command, generated skills, and selftest surface with the native Goal workflow path.
- Update no-question, DB safety, retention, generated rules, docs, and discovery surfaces to use generic SKS run/Goal terminology.

## [0.6.74] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Add schema-backed GPT-5.5 performance artifacts for Work Order Ledgers, effort decisions, From-Chat-IMG visual maps, dogfood reports, Skill Forge, mistake memory, Team dashboard state, Cmux pane plans, and Honest Mode reports.
- Add `sks validate-artifacts` and `sks perf run` so mission evidence and performance budgets are locally checkable.
- Add lightweight effort orchestration, prompt-context ordering, Skill Forge, mistake memory, dogfood, From-Chat-IMG work-order, and Team dashboard renderer modules.

### Changed

- Team mission creation now writes work-order, effort, and dashboard-state artifacts and exposes `sks team dashboard`.
- Make ambiguity-removal awaiting states modal: pending questions are re-exposed in chat and new route prompts cannot replace the active question sheet before answers are sealed.
- Size/performance budgets now reflect the measured zero-dependency package payload after schema/orchestration modules were added.

## [0.6.73] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Make cmux readiness checks validate workspace socket health, not only the cmux executable version, so `sks deps check`, `sks doctor`, `sks cmux check`, and `sks --mad` report unhealthy app/socket states before launch.
- Make `sks team` create a named cmux Team workspace and target each split/send by returned workspace and surface refs, so visible Team lanes open as split panes instead of relying on ambient cmux environment variables.
- Select the newly created cmux Team workspace after launch and report the actual opened lane count, so split panes are brought to the visible workspace instead of opening behind the current cmux view.

## [0.6.72] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Add a bounded stop-hook repeat guard so repeated identical Honest Mode or final completion summary prompts are suppressed instead of re-entering an infinite finalization loop.

## [0.6.71] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Persist SKS-created cmux workspace refs so repeated `sks --mad --high` launches can reuse the last workspace even when cmux workspace listing is incomplete or unstable.
- Block duplicate workspace creation when cmux workspace inspection fails, instead of silently falling through to another `new-workspace` request.

## [0.6.70] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Make `sks --mad` reuse its named cmux workspace and close duplicate SKS-named MAD workspaces instead of creating another workspace on every launch.
- Add pipeline, Team inbox, generated agent, auto-review, and MAD/MAD-SKS policy text that blocks unrequested fallback implementation code.

## [0.6.69] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Add `sks team lane` per-agent monitoring for cmux Team panes, showing agent status, assigned runtime tasks, recent agent events, and a fallback global tail.
- Promote explicit `$From-Chat-IMG` work-order analysis to xhigh temporary reasoning and generated skill metadata.
- Allow runtime commands to work outside any project by falling back to a per-user global SKS root, with `sks root` showing the active project/global root.

## [0.6.68] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Align the `main` merge release metadata after SKS versioning advanced the merge package version during the final commit.

## [0.6.67] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Merge the verified 0.6.66 MAD cmux repair line from `dev` into `main`, preserving the public README emphasis for From-Chat-IMG and TriWiki voxels.

## [0.6.66] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Make `sks --mad` check npm for a newer Sneakoscope release before launch and prompt y/n for updating in interactive terminals.
- Make MAD dependency repair install missing Codex CLI with `@latest`, install or upgrade cmux through Homebrew, and re-probe real cmux app bundle binaries after cask installation.
- Update README MAD/cmux troubleshooting docs for update prompts, `--yes`, and direct cmux app bundle discovery.

## [0.6.65] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Make `sks --mad` launch the cmux MAD profile as full-access high reasoning with Codex automatic approval review enabled via `approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"`.
- Align SKS auto-review profile generation with current OpenAI Codex docs by using `auto_review` instead of the legacy `guardian_subagent` reviewer value.

## [0.6.64] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Expand the README into a fuller open-source CLI guide with quick start, requirements, installation modes, terminal CLI usage, Codex App `$` commands, common workflows, troubleshooting, and release checks.

## [0.6.63] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Make `sks --mad --high` attempt Homebrew cmux installation and re-probe before launch when cmux is missing, with a concise launch blocker if installation cannot complete.
- Replace the first cmux banner box with a stronger SKS/cmux ASCII mark for the CLI workspace header.

## [0.6.62] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Make plain `sks --mad --high` wake the cmux app before creating the `sks-mad-high` Codex CLI workspace, so the command opens the cmux UI path directly.

## [0.6.61] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Replace the SKS terminal runtime with a cmux-based Codex CLI workspace flow, including cmux dependency checks, help/discovery surfaces, setup guidance, and Team cmux live lanes.
- Add `sks --mad --high` as an explicit one-shot cmux launch that writes and uses the `sks-mad-high` full-access high-reasoning Codex profile without changing the normal default route.

## [0.6.60] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Add `$MAD-SKS` as an explicit scoped database authorization modifier that can compose with other dollar-command routes while keeping the widened permission limited to the active invocation.
- Require table-removal operations to pause for short user confirmation even under MAD-SKS, and close the override when the active mission gate is complete.

## [0.6.59] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Merge the dev branch Team runtime graph, From-Chat-IMG completion gates, and active TriWiki attention work into main while preserving the main README positioning for From-Chat-IMG and TriWiki voxels.

### Changed

- Infer predictable ambiguity-gate contract answers from the prompt/default safety policy so SKS asks only unresolved behavior or safety questions instead of static `GOAL_PRECISE` and `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA` templates.

## [0.6.55] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Require From-Chat-IMG completion to include scoped QA-LOOP evidence after the customer-request work is implemented, with every work-order item covered, post-fix verification complete, and zero unresolved QA findings.
- Raise the tracked-file size gate to 288 KiB for the enlarged From-Chat-IMG scoped QA-LOOP selftest while retaining the existing package size gates.

## [0.6.54] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Strengthen From-Chat-IMG completion gates with a required checked work checklist and temporary TriWiki-backed request snapshot, so chat screenshot text, image-region matches, work items, and verification steps are tracked before Team completion.
- Add From-Chat-IMG temporary TriWiki retention handling so session-scoped image-analysis claims can be pruned after the configured later-session TTL.

## [0.6.53] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Add a stop-gated From-Chat-IMG coverage ledger so every visible customer request, screenshot image region, and attachment must be mapped to work-order item(s) with `unresolved_items=[]` before Team completion.
- Teach Team plans, generated skills, prompt context, inferred acceptance criteria, and selftests to require the From-Chat-IMG no-omission work-order coverage pass.
- Add a compliance-loop guard so repeated identical stop-gate blocks produce an evidenced `hard-blocker.json` instead of looping indefinitely, re-evaluate normal gates after later repairs, and bound route runner `--max-cycles` values.
- Raise the tracked-file size gate to 272 KiB for the enlarged CLI selftest and Team plan coverage logic while retaining the 256 KiB packed tarball limit.

## [0.6.52] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Expand README with feature coverage for route commands, Codex App surfaces, workflow rules, release checks, and requirements.
- Raise package size gates to 256 KiB packed and 1 MiB unpacked so shipped README documentation has practical headroom while npm dry-run packaging remains verified.

## [0.6.51] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Expose `$From-Chat-IMG` directly in `sks dollar-commands`, manifests, policy, quick reference, and generated dollar-command output instead of only as a hidden Team picker alias.

## [0.6.50] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Add explicit `$From-Chat-IMG` / `From-Chat-IMG` Team alias for chat-history screenshot plus original attachment intake.
- Gate chat-image analysis behind the explicit From-Chat-IMG signal so ordinary image prompts are not treated as chat captures.
- Require From-Chat-IMG intake to list chat requirements first, use Codex Computer Use visual inspection to strengthen attachment matching, and produce a client modification work order before continuing the normal Team pipeline.
- Raise the package size gates to 168 KiB packed and 644 KiB unpacked for the added command alias, generated skill, and route-gating selftests.

## [0.6.49] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Raise the package size gates to 166 KiB packed and 642 KiB unpacked so the stack-current-docs and final-summary policy surfaces remain publishable.
- Require final answers to omit dirty-worktree boundary wording that the Honest Mode hook treats as an unresolved gap.

## [0.6.48] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Require every pipeline final answer to include a user-visible completion summary explaining what changed, what was verified, and what remains unverified or blocked.
- Block Honest Mode final stop when the completion summary is missing, with selftest coverage for the new stop-gate behavior.

## [0.6.47] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Route question-shaped implicit directives, policy complaints, and mandatory workflow statements to Team instead of Answer.
- Require Team roster confirmation before implementation by materializing `team-roster.json` and enforcing `team_roster_confirmed=true` in Team gates.
- Raise the packed size gate to 165 KiB and unpacked gate to 640 KiB for the added stack-current-docs and Team roster guidance.

## [0.6.46] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Require current Context7 or official-doc evidence whenever stack, framework, package, runtime, or deployment-platform versions change, then record the guidance as high-priority TriWiki claims before coding.
- Add current-doc TriWiki examples for hosted Supabase keys, Next.js 16 proxy files, and Vercel Function duration limits.
- Require the latest coordinate+voxel TriWiki pack shape in validation and pipeline guidance; coordinate-only legacy TriWiki packs now fail validation and must be regenerated before use.
- Keep the package size gate bounded while allowing the required TriWiki voxel validation metadata.

### Fixed

- Treat successful Honest Mode phrases like `No active blocking route gate detected` and verified expected blocking as resolved, so loopback does not reopen on closure evidence.

## [0.6.45] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Add chat-history screenshot intake guidance so SKS extracts visible text, matches screenshot image regions to attachments, and carries the evidence through the normal Team pipeline.
- Raise the package size gate slightly for the added pipeline guidance while keeping the tarball bounded under 628 KiB unpacked.

### Fixed

- Block full-route completion when Team work continues after `reflection-gate.json` was passed, forcing reflection to be refreshed before final Honest Mode.

## [0.6.44] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Use a GitHub raw logo URL in README so npm can render the image.

## [0.6.43] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Make QA-LOOP dogfood real UI/API flows as a human proxy, immediately apply safe contract-allowed fixes, and require focused rechecks before passing the QA gate.

## [0.6.42] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Add full-route reflection with generated `reflection` skill, stop-gate enforcement, and TriWiki lesson recording.
- Add Team `team-session-cleanup.json` as a required pre-reflection gate.
- Require QA-LOOP reports to use `YYYY-MM-DD-v<version>-qa-report.md`.
- Treat verified expected-block evidence as resolved in Honest Mode gap detection.
- Add `sks bootstrap` plus `sks deps check/install` for first-install readiness, and make postinstall point to bootstrap instead of mutating projects by default.
- Reduce Ralph questions for setup work by inferring non-target DB/UI fallback slots from local context.
- Count user request topics in TriWiki packs and prioritize repeated or strongly frustrated feedback as high-weight context for future inference.
- Raise the npm unpacked size budget to 620 KiB so the richer setup, reflection, QA, and TriWiki priority pipeline remains releasable.

## [0.6.41] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- Preserve custom Codex App skills during `sks doctor --fix`.

## [0.6.40] - 2026-04-28

- Preserve user-owned non-generated skill aliases during upgrade/repair while removing obsolete SKS aliases.
- Add selftest coverage for custom skill preservation.

## [0.6.39] - 2026-04-28

- Restore fuller README guidance while keeping package size under the gate.

## [0.6.38] - 2026-04-28

- Seed SKS dollar-command skills into `$HOME/.agents/skills` during package install.
- Report project-local and global dollar-command readiness in `sks codex-app check` and `sks doctor`.
- Add the minimal `ㅅㅋㅅ` README mark.

## [0.6.37] - 2026-04-28

- Add Korean `ㅅㅋㅅ` branding, cmux/setup guidance, Team live event logging, Codex CLI readiness handling, design/image skills, and Team-default execution routing.
- Fix Korean execution-prompt routing, Team continuation after ambiguity gates, Context7 readiness checks, changelog release checks, and Honest Mode loop-back/no-gap handling.
