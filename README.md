<!-- BEGIN SKS SEARCH VISIBILITY MARKETING -->
Sneakoscope Codex (`sks`) is an open-source trust layer for Codex CLI and ChatGPT Desktop. It coordinates bounded AI coding agents, records machine-verifiable evidence, preserves project memory, and blocks release claims that are not supported by current tests or artifacts. Search visibility outcomes are measured separately; SKS does not promise rankings or traffic.
<!-- END SKS SEARCH VISIBILITY MARKETING -->

Current release: **SKS 7.1.0**, with the package preferred Codex channel at **CLI 0.145.0**. SKS stays version-agnostic: older hosts keep working where capabilities allow, while Menu Bar / Center induce updates to the preferred latest. It resolves managed SKS skills from the authoritative global install, preserves a runnable Naruto child slot when `max_threads=2`, and keeps current-version Menu Bar repair transactional so stamped generations remain verifiable. Naruto uses stable opt-in multi-agent V2 when the host exposes it. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## What 7.0.0 Ships

| Problem | 7.0.0 behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Overview mixed Menu Bar, installed SKS, and cached registry versions | Each value is labeled by authority, stale or unavailable probes remain explicit, and Refresh forces a bounded update-status refresh. |
| Naruto stopped creating children after its first wave | The root parent records settled waves, recovers open-thread capacity, rescans the ready DAG, and can launch later direct-child waves under the same workflow run. |
| Most delegated work drifted to Sol Max | Read-heavy discovery uses Terra Medium, ordinary implementation uses Sol High, and Sol Max is reserved for focused high-risk or final judgment slices. |
| Goal creation started a second SKS-owned mission and loop | Codex native Goal is the only persisted owner; create/edit objectives are detailed and bounded, while SKS writes no Goal state or fallback loop. |
| Global instructions accumulated duplicated route rules and forced synthetic tests | One Core Engineering Directive anchors all work, route-specific details stay with their route, and verification targets normal behavior, meaningful boundaries, and plausible failures. |
| GUI-launched status commands could hang or contaminate real update state during tests | Menu Bar commands use a safe HOME cwd, closed stdin, and timeouts; update fixtures use isolated HOME and cache paths. |

## Install In One Command

```sh
npx sneakoscope install --yes
```

That installs or repairs SKS, runs `sks doctor --fix`, and prepares the Codex App integration. The plugin marketplace path is also prepared through `plugins/sks/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

For package-managed installs:

```sh
npm i -g sneakoscope
sks doctor --fix
```

The SKS menu bar shows the installed Codex CLI version and latest known version. An `⬆` marker appears when an update is available; **Update Codex CLI Now** uses native `codex update` when the selected CLI advertises it, otherwise it verifies the installation provenance and invokes the matching official standalone-installer, npm-global, or Homebrew-cask update method. If the method cannot be verified, it fails closed instead of guessing. Control Center updates keep the active UI alive until the operation receipt is durable, then relaunch the companion out of process. This is an explicit global tool mutation. **Run sks doctor --fix** performs the global-only menu repair flow without treating the user's home directory as a project.

**Manage MCP Servers…** opens a native macOS manager for the global `~/.codex/config.toml`. It can add remote URL or local stdio servers, enable/disable existing entries, remove entries after confirmation, and refresh the current state. Mutations are lock-protected, backed up, TOML-validated, and written with mode `0600`; configured environment values and command arguments are never rendered in the list. Changes apply to new Codex sessions. The same plumbing is available through the canonical `sks mcp config list|get|add|edit|duplicate|enable|disable|remove|test|login|logout|backups|restore` surface for diagnostics and automation.

## The Front Door

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `$sks-plan "task"` | Planning only. Writes `.sneakoscope/plans/<slug>.md`; no code edits. |
| Explicit `$sks-work` | Executes the latest plan through evidence-gated SKS work. Ordinary prose containing “work” is not treated as this alias. |
| `$sks-naruto "task"` | Runs the Codex official subagent workflow with parent-owned integration and evidence. |
| `$sks-mad-sks` / `sks mad-sks` | Single high-risk MAD route for scoped permission widening plus SQL-plane execution, including read-back proof and profile closure. |
| `$sks-review` / `sks review --staged` | Reviews diffs with `evidence: machine` findings sorted above `evidence: llm`. |

`sks --mad` now prioritizes the interactive ready path: independent macOS config probes run concurrently, failed read-only preflight does not repeat mutation-capable repair inspection, verified Zellij/codex-lb evidence is reused, and the remote Zellij update lookup runs after the UI is ready. Existing unreadable or malformed config still blocks safely; pass an explicit repair flag such as `--repair-config` when repair is intended.

## Naruto Workflow

`$sks-naruto` and `sks naruto run "task" --agents 8 --max-threads 12` use Codex official subagents. Standalone and Codex App tasks that request project-host database, spreadsheet, or render tools require the non-persistent `--trusted-project` flag after the operator reviews the checkout; an App session ID scopes evidence but does not grant trust. The parent is GPT-5.6 Sol Max. Tiny mechanical `worker` slices use Luna Max; ordinary UI, logic, backend, and native coding uses Sol High; review, testing, debugging, architecture, integration, security, database, research, release, and other judgment-sensitive work uses Sol Max; long-context scans and direct Computer Use, Browser/Chrome, or image-generation execution uses Terra Medium. Mixed execution/judgment work is split when possible, and unsplittable judgment defaults to Sol Max.

Fresh SKS-owned project config enables Codex 0.145+ multi-agent V2 with `agents.max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 12`, `features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 13`, `max_depth = 1`, and `interrupt_message = true`. Nested delegation remains forbidden. Explicit user limits are preserved, and larger requests run in waves.

Gates are task-profile aware: greetings and answer-only turns create no mission gate; tiny work gets minimal verification; parallel work gets scoped ownership and verification; high-risk work keeps the full safety gates. `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` prove lifecycle only. Completion also requires `subagent-parent-summary.json` with one trustworthy structured outcome per thread, correlated with `subagent-events.jsonl` and `subagent-evidence.json`.

Every installed Codex hook runs one common Naruto decision gate. The gate records `none`, `generic_naruto`, or `route_owned`: Answer, DFix, Wiki, Computer Use, Goal, and simple Git/control turns stay lightweight; ordinary non-trivial work defaults to two independent official subagents; critical work spanning at least three risk domains may use three. Research, AutoResearch, and QA-Loop retain their own exact orchestration contracts instead of receiving a second generic fan-out. Explicit `--agents N` remains authoritative.

SKS installs twenty-five narrow project custom agents, including native AppKit, toolchain, protocol, runtime-reliability, TriWiki-evidence, long-context, Computer Use, Browser/Chrome, and image-generation specialists. Delegation prompts inject at most the three roles recommended for the current goal rather than serializing the full catalog, so expanding role coverage does not serialize the full inventory into every prompt. TriWiki context is also bounded and query-aware: ordinary work receives up to four trust/hydration anchors and complex, parallel, or high-risk work receives up to six, with source hydration required before relying on lower-trust hints. In CLI Zellij mode, the right side is a live observability surface rather than a static lane reservation: one monitor plus one viewport by default (maximum three) shows official thread role/model, redacted live phase/task/file updates from rollout-compatible Codex 0.144.1+ sessions while the current release baseline remains 0.145.0, plus `running`, `verifying`, and trustworthy parent-verdict completion/failure states. Rollout activity is display-only and never completion proof.

Official subagent requests use `--agents`; removed scheduler, pool, backend, and model flags fail closed.

## Why Not Just An LLM Reviewer?

| Question | Oracle-style LLM review | SKS gate/review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Did tests/typecheck fail? | Another model may say so. | Machine check output is tagged `evidence: machine`. |
| Are findings ranked? | Usually one blended opinion. | Machine evidence sorts before LLM findings. |
| Can work stop? | The model decides. | Stop gates, Completion Proof, and Honest Mode decide. |
| Can I inspect agent-thread progress? | Usually no runtime UI. | Use the official Codex subagent/thread surfaces and SKS Zellij monitor/viewport panes. |

## Demo

The reproducible VHS script lives at [docs/demo.tape](docs/demo.tape).

```sh
vhs docs/demo.tape
```

It shows the current quickstart flow: one-line install, `$sks-plan`, `sks review`, `sks status --json`, and an official `$sks-naruto` subagent run.

## Proof Surfaces

- Official subagents: `sks naruto run "task" --agents 14 --max-threads 12 [--trusted-project] --json`
- Review report: `.sneakoscope/reports/review-report.json`
- Harness benchmark: `.sneakoscope/reports/harness-benchmark.json`
- Project memory: `sks memory build`
- Codebase index/pack for LLM context: `sks wiki refresh --code`, `sks wiki validate --json` (code-pack freshness)
- Native capability repair: `sks doctor --fix` (imagegen/Computer Use/Browser Use), `.sneakoscope/reports/native-capability-readiness.json`
- codex-lb continuity: `sks codex-lb status --json` verifies the selected proxy's unauthenticated `/health` `X-App-Version`. Tool-heavy continuation requires codex-lb `1.21.0-beta.3` or later; older or unverified deployments block setup, doctor, and launch instead of silently falling back.
- Agent bridge for any agent system: `sks mcp-server`, `sks agent-bridge setup`, `SKS_AGENT_MODE=1` — see [docs/AGENT-BRIDGE.md](docs/AGENT-BRIDGE.md)
- Release gates: `npm run release:check:affected` for ordinary change-aware verification and `npm run release:check:confidence` for the final local confidence pass.
- Release preparation: typecheck, one clean build, focused tests, affected/confidence gates, then `npm publish --dry-run --json --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/ --tag latest --access public`. The dry-run does not publish; authorization remains a separate maintainer workflow.
- Release readiness notes: [docs/release-readiness.md](docs/release-readiness.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- Image generation review routes require Codex App `$imagegen`/`gpt-image-2` evidence with recorded output hashes; direct API fallback and mock fixtures do not satisfy full route gates.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=20.11`
- Git for diff/review and release proof
- macOS optional: menu bar integration and `/usr/bin/open`
  - The menubar icon shows and hides itself automatically as the Codex desktop app launches/quits; set `quit_with_codex: true` in `~/.codex/sks-menubar/config.json` to have the menubar fully quit with Codex instead of just hiding (default `false`).
  - Native input dialogs (API keys, codex-lb setup) pass secrets to `sks` via `--api-key-stdin` instead of a visible Terminal window or process arguments.
  - Auth/provider changes require a successful app restart; skipped or failed restarts fail the action.
  - `sks update` preserves the selected codex-lb or ChatGPT OAuth mode, model, reasoning, catalog, and routing state.
  - Providers exposes **Restore Chat / Pro (OAuth)** as an explicit auth-mode switch while retaining saved codex-lb credentials.
  - Update installs always rebuild the companion with the newly installed SKS package, preventing a previous-version updater from restoring a stale menu binary.
  - The menubar dropdown's `View Last Log` item opens the most recent background action's log file, so you don't need to keep a Terminal window open to see command output.
  - `Manage MCP Servers…` provides a resizable native table and add/remove/enable/disable controls for global Codex MCP configuration. Secret environment values and command arguments are accepted through native dialogs/stdin but omitted from list output and logs.
  - `sks menubar status --json` reports a `codex_sync` object with `bundle_id`, `codex_running`, and `icon_visible_expected` to show Codex-lifecycle detection state.
  - The menu displays the installed Codex CLI version, adds an `⬆` status icon when `sks codex update-status` sees a newer release, runs the official self-updater through `Update Codex CLI Now`, and exposes `Run sks doctor --fix` as a background repair action.
  - Fast mode has a verified status row and direct On/Off actions. Status failures render as unavailable with neither choice falsely selected.
- If Codex shows `[No tool output found for custom tool call ...]`, SKS blocks reuse of that structurally ambiguous thread. Upgrade codex-lb (or explicitly run `sks codex-lb use-oauth`), inspect possible side effects, then continue the persisted mission in a fresh Codex task. SKS never rewrites session JSONL or fabricates a successful tool output.
- Zellij optional but recommended for terminal worker panes
