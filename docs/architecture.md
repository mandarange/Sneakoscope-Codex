# Architecture

The active architecture keeps user-facing commands lazy-loaded through `src/cli/command-registry.ts` and keeps `src/core/pipeline.ts` as the single compatibility facade.

Core trust modules added in 0.9.20:

- `src/core/trust-kernel/`
- `src/core/evidence/`
- `src/core/managed-paths.ts`
- `src/core/bench.ts`

Release architecture gates:

```bash
npm run architecture:check
npm run route-modularity:check
npm run command-budget:check
npm run pipeline-budget:check
npm run pipeline-runtime:check
```

`config/architecture-budgets.v1.json` is the single source of truth for architecture line budgets. `architecture:check` computes committed changes from `git merge-base HEAD <base-ref>` (preferring `origin/main`) and also includes staged, unstaged, and untracked files. This keeps a clean feature checkout observable instead of relying on `git diff HEAD`. Use `--base-ref <ref>` to seal a comparison target and `--strict-all` for release-wide enforcement.

Hard thresholds in the budget SSOT:

- Menu Bar compatibility facade: `80` lines.
- Menu Bar TypeScript modules: `450` lines.
- Menu Bar AppDelegate: `250` lines.
- Other Menu Bar Swift modules: `500` lines.
- Command modules: `900` lines.
- Pipeline, trust-kernel, evidence, and proof modules: `1200` lines.
- Other handwritten source: `1800` lines.
- Any handwritten file at `3000` lines enters the split-review gate.

Every over-budget legacy waiver is `shrink-only`: it records the merge-base line ceiling and an expiry version, cannot be used for a new file, and fails as soon as the file grows. A waiver never raises the shared budget.
# 1.0.0 Architecture Gates

Architecture warnings are release failures.

Hard thresholds are read from the budget SSOT:

- any handwritten file above `1800` lines fails;
- core pipeline/trust-kernel/evidence/proof files above `1200` lines fail;
- command modules above `900` lines fail;
- files that directly import five or more unrelated route domains fail unless they are explicit route-domain aggregators.

The pipeline runtime compatibility surface stays split: `src/core/pipeline-internals/runtime-core.ts` remains under the 1200-line pipeline gate, while stop/gate evaluation lives in `src/core/pipeline-internals/runtime-gates.ts`.

## OpenRouter Desktop Provider

OpenRouter for Codex Desktop is centered on key save + explicit model activation (not a separate GLM MAD CLI):

- `src/core/providers/openrouter/openrouter-secret-store.ts` owns the user-scoped OpenRouter key lifecycle outside project files.
- `src/core/providers/openrouter/openrouter-client.ts` is the only OpenRouter network adapter.
- `src/core/codex-app/openrouter-activate.ts` selects `model_provider = "openrouter"` and the chosen model via `sks codex-app use-openrouter --model` (and SKS Center Providers).
- `src/core/codex-app/glm-profile-installer.ts` strips retired Desktop GLM picker profiles and ensures the OpenRouter provider table used by `use-openrouter`.

The former GLM MAD CLI (`sks --mad --glm`, `sks glm`) and `src/core/providers/glm/` runtime were removed; ordinary `sks --mad` is unchanged.

## Codex Desktop Multi-Provider Router

`src/core/codex-app/multi-provider-router.ts` is a configuration and verification adapter, not a proxy implementation. It permits a single loopback-only Responses endpoint (default `http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1`), reads an external JSON catalog of `provider/model` slugs, probes the router's `/v1/models` without following redirects or buffering an unbounded response, and writes the selected user-level `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` provider/model/catalog settings only after the requested model appears in both sources.

The configured provider is `sks-router`, a custom provider table using `wire_api = "responses"` and explicit `requires_openai_auth = false`. Its security contract is deliberately unauthenticated from SKS's point of view: the table must not contain `env_key`, bearer-token values, credential headers, or a provider auth table. Router process lifecycle, upstream provider credentials, provider registration, and upstream policy remain outside SKS. The loopback restriction prevents a remote router URL and rejects URLs with embedded credentials, query strings, or paths other than `/v1`; it does not authenticate the local peer.

The catalog is part of the configuration contract rather than a UI-only picker. It must be an owner-only regular file containing a top-level `models` array whose rows satisfy the current Codex `ModelInfo` core fields; partial rows, symlinks, insecure modes, duplicate slugs, and oversized catalogs fail closed. Configuration refuses an unmarked user catalog replacement unless `--replace-catalog` is explicit, uses compare-before-write guarded commit, and validates the written TOML plus a guarded readback. A successful config write and Desktop restart are reported separately from runtime adoption: the adapter sets `runtime_verified = false` until App Server/model and Responses execution are proven externally.

This design takes catalog and Responses-protocol compatibility from OpenCodex reference commit `9e68ed67303580ecf0bcde0a56b71b874304fc54`, but does not embed OpenCodex or use its documented built-in `openai_base_url` loopback mode. That source uses port `10100` by default and atomically maintains `$CODEX_HOME/opencodex-catalog.json`; SKS's defaults intentionally consume those real outputs rather than inventing a parallel catalog sync. OpenCodex users must stamp routed role entries with `multi_agent_version = "v2"` so they match Codex multi-agent V2. SKS currently uses the custom `sks-router` provider table so it never has to retain router credentials. Compatibility therefore requires an independently operated router that exposes loopback `/v1/models` and Responses behavior; it is not evidence that every OpenCodex feature or provider works under Codex Desktop.

Role-model preferences in `src/core/subagents/role-model-preferences.ts` are a separate owner-only preference store. Routed preferences are accepted only while `sks-router` is the selected backend and the exact catalog row advertises the requested reasoning effort plus `multi_agent_version = "v2"`; the same binding is revalidated during mission preparation. Since `spawn_agent` has no provider parameter, provider routing is resolved by the selected catalog/backend. Spawn-time custom agent, model, or reasoning overrides require bounded rather than full-history forking. Operators accept any OpenCodex cross-provider native multi-agent V2 task-body risk when using routed overrides; this is still not a substitute for a real routed official-subagent round trip.
