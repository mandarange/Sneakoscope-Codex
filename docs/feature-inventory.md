# SKS Feature Inventory

Generated from `sks commands --json`, `src/cli/command-registry.ts COMMANDS`, `src/core/routes.js`, docs, and skill manifests.

## Coverage

- Status: coverage-ok
- Features: 137
- CLI commands: 100
- Handler keys: 100
- Dollar routes: 31
- App skill aliases: 34
- Skills: 1
- Fixture statuses: pass=127, blocked=10
- Feature quality: runtime_verified=95, wiring_only=19, integration_optional=6, static_contract=17, missing=0

## Release Coverage Rule

`sks features check --json` fails when a CLI command, hidden handler, dollar route, app skill alias, or project skill is not mapped to the feature registry. `npm run release:check` runs that check.

## Prompt Checklist Coverage

- [x] Collected the complete `sks commands --json` command surface via `COMMAND_MANIFEST_LITE`.
- [x] Collected the actual `src/cli/command-registry.ts` `COMMANDS` handler keys, including hidden handlers.
- [x] Collected dollar routes and app skill aliases from `src/core/routes.js`.
- [x] Scanned README, Codex quick reference, AGENTS, and generated skill manifest for dollar-route mentions.
- [x] Mapped project skills from `.agents/skills` into the registry.
- [x] Exposed the registry through `sks features list --json`.
- [x] Added a release coverage check through `sks features check --json`.
- [x] Documented fixture status for every registry feature.
