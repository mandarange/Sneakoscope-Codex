# Known Gaps

## 1.0.8 Known Gaps

No P0 blocker is intentionally left open for Codex CLI `rust-v0.133.0` compatibility detection, `codex exec resume --output-schema` fixture coverage, UX-Review generated callout ingestion, text-only fallback blocking, mock-as-real blocking, Image Voxel relation validation, memory summary rebuilds, repeated blocker stops, version drift, or release readiness reporting.

Bounded 1.0.8 claims:

- The Codex hook schema snapshot is `latest` for SKS 1.14.1; the runtime matrix targets `rust-v0.133.0` capability detection and preserves the zero-warning strict subset.
- Codex 0.133 plugin discovery and marketplace config are P1 warning-only unless a route explicitly depends on those surfaces.
- Real UX-Review verification requires a real generated gpt-image-2 annotated callout image and post-fix recapture/re-review evidence for changed screens. Fixture, mock, and unavailable/unlinked imagegen loops are `verified_partial`; unavailable/unlinked imagegen may close as `verified_partial/reference-only` only with source screenshots plus hashes, docs evidence, source Image Voxel anchors, and Honest Mode evidence.
- If Codex App imagegen or Computer Use is unavailable, SKS records a structured blocker such as `imagegen_capability_missing` or `live_capture_blocked`; it does not fabricate screenshots, generated callouts, or fixed-screen evidence.
- Codex Python SDK auth and richer TurnResult integration are P1 warning-only review items; no live SDK accuracy or performance claim is made.

P1 future enhancements:

- Wire a real Codex App-hosted imagegen adapter once the host exposes a callable artifact handoff to CLI processes.
- Expand real-world doctor probe batching benchmarks across terminal/App launch modes.

## 1.0.7 Known Gaps

No P0 blocker is intentionally left open for Computer Use live evidence mode, Computer Use local-only privacy, Image Voxel linkage-or-reason recording, codex-lb persistence truthfulness, process-only ephemeral warnings, docs truthfulness, or release readiness reporting.

Bounded 1.0.7 claims:

- Computer Use live evidence is opt-in. `probe_only` is the default and `live_capture_success` requires official Codex App/macOS capture capability; unavailable capture records `live_capture_blocked` with a structured reason instead of fabricated evidence.
- Computer Use screenshots are local-only by default. Shared TriWiki can record metadata/anchors, but screenshot binaries are not published automatically.
- Browser Use evidence and manual screenshots are separate evidence sources, not substitutes for Computer Use live evidence.
- codex-lb setup reports `durable_env_file`, `durable_keychain`, `durable_launchctl`, `shell_profile`, `process_only_ephemeral`, or `none` according to actual setup choices and effects. If all durable choices are off, the next shell may require setup or explicit environment variables again.
- Recovery commands: `sks computer-use smoke --json`, `sks computer-use smoke --real --capture-screenshot --json`, and `sks codex-lb setup --write-env-file --keychain --launchctl`.

P1 future enhancements:

- Broaden real-world macOS Screen Recording/Accessibility detection once Codex App exposes a stable capture API to CLI processes.
- Add more fixture permutations for GUI-launch environment propagation across shells and managed macOS profiles.

## 1.0.6 Known Gaps

No P0 blocker is intentionally left open for latest Codex hook schema validation, category-aware strict-subset semantic hook validation, hook trust warning-zero release gates, codex-lb setup plan/apply truthfulness, codex-lb missing-env prevention, or optional Computer Use live smoke status.

Bounded claims:

- A local Codex CLI older than `0.133.0` reports `compatibility_degraded`; release hook validation still uses the vendored `latest` snapshot and semantic validator.
- Live Computer Use availability depends on Codex App and macOS permissions. If the official capability is blocked or unavailable, SKS records the status and does not fabricate UI evidence. Real smoke remains opt-in with `SKS_TEST_REAL_COMPUTER_USE=1`.
- codex-lb health checks can still report structured network/auth blockers; the fixed invariant is that raw missing `CODEX_LB_API_KEY` messages and secret leaks are release failures.
- The 1.0.6 black-box fixtures validate warning-zero, strict-subset classification, setup plan/apply truthfulness, codex-lb missing-env prevention, and no forbidden Computer Use wording; broader real-world Codex App/OS capability permutations remain environment-dependent.

0.9.20 strengthens the core trust kernel, but these claims remain bounded:

- Real model/scout speedup is not claimed unless `real_parallel=true`, parsed outputs are present, and benchmark artifacts pass.
- Fixture and mock route completions are `verified_partial`, not live production evidence.
- `sks bench blackbox` records the budget surface; full package install execution still lives in `npm run blackbox:check` and `npm run blackbox:matrix` with `SKS_REAL_BLACKBOX_MATRIX=1`.
- Some older internal files remain extraction candidates. `npm run architecture:check` warns on files over 1500 lines and fails on 3000-line split-review risk in active `src/`.
- Rust acceleration is optional. JS fallback parity remains the release requirement unless `--require-native` is used.
- Feature quality improved to zero missing fixtures and lower static contracts, but `runtime_mock_verified >= 45` remains a P1 target rather than a 0.9.20 P0 claim.

Static contracts are not runtime verification. They document expected behavior and must be promoted through executable fixtures before being used as completion proof.
# 1.0.3 Known Gaps

No P0 stable-release blocker is intentionally left open for TypeScript-built `dist` runtime, actual typed command registry, package boundary, command import smoke, `sks run --execute`, strict TypeScript suppression gates, feature quality, architecture hard-fail, performance tiers, or Trust Kernel stale/mock/static blocking.

Remaining non-P0 work:

- Broaden DB safety fixture volume and SQL parser edge cases beyond the current release gate.
- Add more native/Rust acceleration paths for large Image Voxel ledgers.
- Legacy `.mjs` source files are retained only outside the published package boundary as compatibility/reference surfaces; the package runtime and command import closure are TypeScript-built `.js` under `dist`.
- Wrongness memory now captures DB, hook, image, trust, and test negative evidence in fixtures; broader real-world classification coverage remains future work and must not be claimed as exhaustive.
- Git collaboration now validates shared memory shards and local runtime ignores, but SKS still does not auto-install Git hooks. Teams must wire `sks git precommit` into their own hook if they want automatic local enforcement.
