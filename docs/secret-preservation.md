# Secret Preservation

SKS 3.1.13 protects Supabase and secret-like config values across setup, update, and doctor repair paths. The guard rolls back both missing protected values and changed protected-value hashes, including nested `doctor --fix` repair flows that touch startup, MCP, app UI, Zellij, and native capability config.

Protected surfaces include common Supabase environment keys, Supabase JSON config paths, and Supabase MCP config keys. Secret snapshots record:

- key name
- source path
- present/missing state
- hash-only redacted preview
- SHA-256 fingerprint

Raw secret values are never written to reports.

`withSecretPreservationGuard(root, operationName, fn)` captures a before snapshot, backs up every secret-bearing source, runs the operation, captures an after snapshot, and compares both missing and changed value hashes. If a previously present protected value disappears or changes, the guard first restores only the changed protected assignment lines when safe, preserving unrelated operator edits. JSON files, deleted files, or unparseable cases fall back to whole-file restoration from `.sneakoscope/backups/secrets/<operation>/<timestamp>/`. Rollback mode, nested operations, and unrelated-change preservation are recorded; rollback failure hard-fails the operation.

Nested guards reuse the active outer transaction, so `doctor --fix` can wrap setup, config repair, app UI repair, Zellij repair, native repair, and capability repair in one secret-preservation boundary.
