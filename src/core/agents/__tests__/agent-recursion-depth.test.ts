/**
 * Two reported symptoms, one cause: the runtime guard was reading a marker
 * nobody sets.
 *
 * `native-cli-worker-runtime` marks a worker by putting `SKS_AGENT_WORKER=1`
 * into the spawned *process* environment. The hook that is supposed to refuse a
 * nested fan-out read only the tool-call payload, so an agent running
 * `sks naruto run` through its shell — which has no reason to redeclare that
 * variable in the tool input — sailed straight through. Unbounded nesting was
 * one consequence. The other was that the same predicate gates whether a hook
 * hands out parent wave-spawn guidance, so child workers were being told to
 * spawn the parent's own waves and re-ran the parent's session instead of their
 * assigned slice.
