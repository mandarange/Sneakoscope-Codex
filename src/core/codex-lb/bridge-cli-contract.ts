/**
 * The one option table the `sks bridge` CLI and the launchd plist both read.
 *
 * 9.2.3 shipped a plist that always passed `--supervised` and a parser that had
 * never registered it. The per-subcommand allowlist for `serve` DID permit the
 * flag — two hand-written tables that had to agree, and only one of them was
 * consulted first. So launchd started the service, `parseArgs` threw
 * `bridge_command_unknown_option` before any subcommand was reached, KeepAlive
 * declined to restart a process that had exited cleanly, and Codex reconnected
 * forever against a dead loopback port. The operator saw "update succeeded" and
 * a bridge that was never up.
 *
 * A flag reaches the CLI only by being listed here, and `desktopBridgeServeArguments`
 * refuses to emit one that is not — the divergence cannot be written again.

 * runtime detector reads the same constant, so the flag the plist writes and
 * the flag `desktopBridgeIsSupervised` looks for cannot drift apart either.
 *
 * The check below is not defensive coding against user input — this argv is a
 * literal. It is the assertion that keeps a future flag from being added here
 * without being registered above, where the failure would otherwise be a
 * service that exits at every launchd start with only a log line to say so.
