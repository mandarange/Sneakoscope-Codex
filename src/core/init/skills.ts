List exact micro-edits, inspect only needed files, apply only those edits, and run cheap verification. Keep broad implementation out of DFix; for UI/UX micro-edits read \`design.md\` when present and use imagegen for image/logo/raster assets. Bypass broad SKS routing, mission state, TriWiki/TriFix/reflection/state recording, Goal, Research, eval, redesign, and repeated full-route Honest Mode loops. Report the change, actual verification, and remaining issues once. ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY}\n`,
    'answer': `---\nname: answer\ndescription: Answer questions with research or docs; never implement.\n---\n\nUse for explanations, comparisons, status, facts, source-backed research, or docs guidance. Use repo/TriWiki first for project-local facts; hydrate low-trust claims from source. Browse or use Context7 for current external package/API/framework/MCP docs. End with a concise answer that separates what was verified from what was inferred; do not create missions, subagents, or file edits.\n`,
    'sks': `---\nname: sks\ndescription: Use $sks for setup, status, conflicts, or SKS commands.\n---\n\nUse local SKS commands: bootstrap, deps, commands, quickstart, codex-app, context7, guard, conflicts, reasoning, wiki, pipeline status, pipeline plan, skill-dream. Route code-changing work through Naruto, where the parent orchestrates child slices instead of implementing them itself; keep answers, SKS commands, and tiny DFix edits in the current task. Surface route/guard/scope, use TriWiki, do not edit installed harness files outside this engine repo, and clear conflicting third-party Codex harness markers via \`sks conflicts cleanup --yes\`. ${skillDreamPolicyText()}\n`,
    'plan': `---\nname: plan\ndescription: Write a plan artifact only; never edit product or source files.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Plan or asks for a plan-only frontdoor. Produce a concrete plan artifact under .sneakoscope/plans/<slug>.md with goal, scope, files to inspect, implementation steps, acceptance checks, and rollback notes. Do not edit product/source files, generated harness files, package metadata, or docs beyond the plan artifact. Keep implementation_allowed=false and hand off execution to $Work only after the user or route explicitly moves from planning to work. Finish with what is planned and what remains unimplemented.\n`,
    'work': `---\nname: work\ndescription: Execute the latest .sneakoscope plan with evidence-gated close.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Work or asks to execute the latest SKS plan. Resolve the newest .sneakoscope/plans/*.md, route execution through Naruto evidence gates, keep leases and verification artifacts current, and do not claim completion without machine evidence or explicit blocker evidence. If no plan exists, block with a clear next action: run $Plan first or provide a task.\n`,
    'review': `---\nname: review\ndescription: Review a selected diff with machine evidence first.\n---\n\nUse when the user asks for $Review or sks review. Review the selected diff read-only unless --fix is explicitly supplied. Machine evidence such as TypeScript, lint, tests, conflict markers, or secret scans outranks LLM findings and must be tagged evidence: machine; judgment-only findings must be tagged evidence: llm. --fix may attempt at most one machine-evidence fix pass and must re-run verification once. Do not mutate code for LLM-only opinions.\n`,
    'fast-mode': `---\nname: fast-mode\ndescription: Toggle Codex Desktop Fast mode via $sks-fast-mode.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Fast-Mode, $Fast-On, $Fast-Off, or asks to turn SKS Fast mode on/off. Prefer \`sks fast-mode on|off|status|clear --json\`. By default on/off updates the global Codex Desktop config so Codex Fast mode (official service_tier) persists and also keeps .sneakoscope/state/fast-mode.json in sync for SKS workers. Use \`--project\` only when the user explicitly wants project-local worker preference without touching global Codex config. Explicit runtime flags still win: \`--fast\`, \`--no-fast\`, and \`--service-tier standard|fast\` override the saved preference for that run. Finish with a short status; do not start Naruto or broad implementation for a toggle-only request.\n`,
    'fast-on': `---\nname: fast-on\ndescription: Enable Codex Desktop Fast mode via $sks-fast-on.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as fast-mode. Run or instruct \`sks fast-mode on --json\`, then report Global (desktop), Project (sks workers), state file, and the fact that explicit per-run flags still override the saved preference.\n`,
    'fast-off': `---\nname: fast-off\ndescription: Disable Codex Desktop Fast mode via $sks-fast-off.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as fast-mode. Run or instruct \`sks fast-mode off --json\`, then report Global (desktop), Project (sks workers), state file, and the fact that explicit per-run flags still override the saved preference.\n`,
    'wiki': `---\nname: wiki\ndescription: Run $sks-wiki to pack, validate, or prune TriWiki memory.\n---\n\nUse for $Wiki pack, validate, prune, image/voxel, or wrongness requests. Code-index / wiki+pack rebuild SSOT is \`$Align\` / \`sks align run\` (NC-21). \`sks wiki refresh --code\` aliases into align and is not a parallel truth source. Memory pack refresh without --code may still use \`sks wiki refresh\` then validate .sneakoscope/wiki/context-pack.json. Prune: \`sks wiki prune --dry-run\` first. Do not start ambiguity-gated implementation, nested subagents, or unrelated work. Report the result and remaining gaps once.\n`,
    'align': `---\nname: align\ndescription: Run $sks-align to rebuild TriWiki from current repository code.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Align or asks to rebuild TriWiki from current repository code. Align is independent of triwiki-cleanup / $Cleanup and does not require a cleanup receipt. Run \`sks align prepare\` then \`sks align run\` (or \`sks align run\` directly). context-graph.json is exhaustive authority; context-pack and managed AGENTS.md are bounded projections. Fail closed on caps/binary/oversized sources. Do not nest subagents. Agents never run \`sks doctor --fix\`. Report actual verification and remaining gaps once; reflection and Honest Mode are optional unless requested or required by the strict profile.\n`,
    'cleanup': `---\nname: cleanup\ndescription: Run $sks-cleanup to blank active TriWiki after plan review.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Cleanup or explicitly asks for triwiki-cleanup (blank/reset active TriWiki). This is NOT harness-conflicts-cleanup (\`sks conflicts cleanup\`). Run \`sks cleanup plan\` first, then \`sks cleanup run --apply\` only after the plan is reviewed. No backup/quarantine/restore generation is retained on success. Preserve repository source, ordinary docs, missions, and release evidence. Never run \`sks doctor --fix\`. Do not start Naruto, nested subagents, or unrelated implementation from this route.\n`,
    'from-chat-img': `---\nname: from-chat-img\ndescription: Use $sks-from-chat-img for chat screenshot plus attachments.\n---\n\nUse only for From-Chat-IMG/$From-Chat-IMG. It enters the Naruto pipeline with from_chat_img_required=true and an add-on coverage gate. Treat uploads as chat screenshot plus originals. For web/browser/webapp targets use Codex Chrome Extension first; for native Mac/non-web app surfaces use Codex Computer Use visual inspection when available. List requirements first, match regions to attachments with confidence, write ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_COVERAGE_ARTIFACT}, ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_CHECKLIST_ARTIFACT}, ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_ARTIFACT}, and ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_QA_LOOP_ARTIFACT}, then continue Naruto worker proof, review, reflection, and Honest Mode. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY} The ledger must account for every visible customer request, screenshot image region, and separate attachment; ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_CHECKLIST_ARTIFACT} must have a checked item for each request, image-region/attachment match, work item, scoped QA-LOOP, and verification step; ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_ARTIFACT} stores temporary TriWiki-backed session context with expires_after_sessions=${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_SESSIONS}. ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_QA_LOOP_ARTIFACT} must prove QA-LOOP ran over the exact customer-request work-order range after implementation, with every work item covered, post-fix verification complete, and zero unresolved findings. naruto-gate.json cannot pass From-Chat-IMG completion until from_chat_img_request_coverage=true, unresolved_items is empty, every checklist box is checked, and scoped_qa_loop_completed=true.\n`,
    'qa-loop': `---\nname: qa-loop\ndescription: Run $sks-qa-loop for UI/API dogfood with QA ledgers.\n---\n\nUse only $QA-LOOP. Infer scope, target, mutation policy, and login boundary from the prompt plus TriWiki/current-code defaults; do not surface a prequestion sheet. Credentials are runtime-only; never save secrets. Web/browser/webapp UI-level E2E must run the Codex Chrome Extension readiness gate first; if the extension is missing or disabled, rapidly halt and ask the user to set it up, then resume only after the user confirms installation is complete. Codex Computer Use is reserved for native Mac/non-web surfaces and must not satisfy web UI evidence. Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer, Browser Use, Chrome MCP, screenshots fabricated from code, and prose-only checks do not satisfy web UI/browser verification. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} Deployed targets are read-only; destructive removal is forbidden. After answer/run, dogfood real flows, apply safe contract-allowed code/test/docs fixes, recheck, and do not pass qa-gate.json with unresolved findings or without post_fix_verification_complete. Finish qa-ledger, date/version report, gate, completion summary, and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'ppt': `---\nname: ppt\ndescription: Run $sks-ppt to create an HTML/PDF presentation artifact.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $PPT or asks to create a presentation, deck, slides, pitch deck, proposal deck, HTML presentation, or PDF presentation artifact. Before artifact work, auto-seal presentation-specific answers from prompt, TriWiki/current-code defaults, and conservative policy: delivery context, target audience profile including role/average age/job/industry/topic familiarity/decision power, STP strategy, decision context and objections, and 3+ pain-point to solution mappings with expected aha moments. Do not surface a prequestion sheet. Presentation design must be simple, restrained, and information-first: avoid over-designed decoration, ornamental gradients, nested cards, and effects that compete with the message. Design detail should be embedded through typography hierarchy, spacing, alignment, thin rules, source clarity, and subtle accents. ${pptPipelineAllowlistPolicyText()} Use Product Design plugin first for context, ideation, prototype direction, audit, design QA, and share handoff. Use design.md only as an existing project-local cache or fallback SSOT when Product Design is unavailable; if fallback creation is needed, use docs/Design-Sys-Prompt.md plus getdesign-reference and curated DESIGN.md examples from ${AWESOME_DESIGN_MD_REFERENCE.url} only as source inputs, then fuse them into route-local PPT style tokens with a recorded design_ssot instead of treating references as parallel authorities. The $PPT route always loads imagegen as a required skill and checks the active SKS image mode at route start (\`sks imagegen status --json\`), reporting a blocked mode instead of switching to another image path. When the sealed contract needs a generated raster asset or generated slide visual critique, generate it with \`sks imagegen generate --prompt <text> --out <file>\` (the active SKS image mode), move/copy the selected output into the mission assets or review evidence path, and record the real file path in ppt-image-asset-ledger.json or ppt-review-ledger.json before building or passing the gate. Direct API fallback, placeholder files, HTML/CSS stand-ins, and prose-only substitutes do not satisfy the route gate. ${productDesignPluginPolicyText()} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY} Use web or Context7 evidence only when external facts/libraries/current docs are required by the PPT contract, record verified claims in ppt-fact-ledger.json, record generated image asset plans/results/blockers in ppt-image-asset-ledger.json, then create the PDF plus editable source HTML under source-html/, keep independent strategy/render/file-write phases parallel where inputs allow, record ppt-parallel-report.json, run the bounded ppt-review-policy/ppt-review-ledger/ppt-iteration-report loop, and verify readability, overlap, format fit, source coverage, export state, unsupported-claim status, image-asset completion, review-loop termination, and temporary build files cleanup. Finish with reflection and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'computer-use-fast': `---\nname: computer-use-fast\ndescription: Fast $sks-computer-use alias for native Mac/non-web work.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as computer-use: skip Naruto delegation, QA-LOOP clarification, upfront TriWiki refresh, Context7, subagents, and reflection unless explicitly requested. Use Codex Computer Use directly only for native macOS, desktop-app, OS-settings, or non-web visual tasks. Browser, localhost, website, webapp, and web-based app verification must use the Codex Chrome Extension path first and must halt if that extension is not installed/enabled. At the end only, refresh/pack TriWiki, validate it, then provide a concise completion summary that separates what was verified from what was not. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY}\n`,
    'cu': `---\nname: cu\ndescription: Short $sks-cu alias for native Mac Computer Use evidence.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as computer-use. This is a speed lane for native macOS, desktop-app, OS-settings, and non-web visual tasks requiring Codex Computer Use evidence, with TriWiki refresh/validate and Honest Mode deferred to final closeout. Web/browser/webapp verification must use Codex Chrome Extension first and stop if the extension is not installed/enabled. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY}\n`,
    'goal': `---\nname: goal\ndescription: Create or edit a Codex native /goal; no SKS Goal state.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Goal/$goal or asks to create, edit, view, pause, resume, or clear a persisted goal. Use only Codex native Goal controls or the callable native goal tool. Handle the Goal control turn entirely with Codex native Goal controls; it creates no SKS mission, TriWiki refresh, or subagents. Before create or edit, expand the request into explicit Outcome, Scope, Constraints, Verification, Done when, Stop conditions, and Non-goals. Completion criteria must be measurable and must stop work once satisfied; forbid unrelated refactors, speculative expansion, and open-ended polishing. If native Goal is unavailable, report that limitation instead of substituting an SKS implementation.\n`,
    'release-review': `---\nname: release-review\ndescription: Run $sks-release-review for official release-readiness audit.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Release-Review or asks for a release-readiness review. Run it through \`sks naruto run \"$Release-Review release audit\" --agents <n> --read-only --json\` or the current Codex parent session. The parent owns decomposition, waits for every official worker/expert thread, integrates one structured outcome per thread, and records subagent-plan.json, subagent-events.jsonl, subagent-parent-summary.json, and subagent-evidence.json. No alternate Release-Review runtime is supported. Finish with release-readiness verification and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'commit': `---\nname: commit\ndescription: Commit current git changes without the full SKS pipeline.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Commit or explicitly asks to commit the current repository changes without pushing. Keep this route lightweight: inspect git status and the relevant diff summary, avoid Naruto/pipeline/TriWiki route work unless separately requested, stage the intended current changes, and create one git commit. The commit message must summarize the actual work and include exactly one trailer: Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>. Do not push. If there are no changes, report that no commit was created. Finish with the commit hash and any unverified items.\n`,
    'commit-and-push': `---\nname: commit-and-push\ndescription: Commit and push current git changes without the SKS pipeline.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Commit-And-Push or explicitly asks to commit and push the current repository changes. Keep this route lightweight: inspect git status and the relevant diff summary, avoid Naruto/pipeline/TriWiki route work unless separately requested, stage the intended current changes, create one git commit, then push the current branch. The commit message must summarize the actual work and include exactly one trailer: Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>. If there are no changes, do not create an empty commit unless the user explicitly asks for one. Finish with the commit hash, pushed branch, and any unverified items.\n`,
    'research': `---\nname: research\ndescription: Run $sks-research for evidence-bound discovery, not code edits.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Research/$research or asks for research, hypotheses, new mechanisms, falsification, or testable predictions. Prefer sks research prepare and sks research run. Research is not an implementation route: do not edit repository source, docs, package metadata, generated skills, or harness files; write only route-local mission artifacts under .sneakoscope/missions/<mission-id>/. Frame the research criteria and map assumptions before retrieval. First run layered Super Search across current papers, primary/official sources, standards, public discourse, practitioner evidence, background sources, and explicit counterevidence; only verified-content source rows may support real-run reviewer claims. Then run three independent official Codex subagent threads using the project custom agent research_reviewer, covering evidence integrity, method validity, and falsification or replication. Do not launch a custom debate scheduler, worker pool, or synthetic model fanout. Each reviewer must return a structured adversarial outcome with source ids, falsifiers, and cheap probes. Critical, major, or required revisions trigger a mission-local research_synthesizer revision and a fresh three-thread review cycle within the bounded cycle cap; minor concerns remain advisory. agent-ledger.json and debate-ledger.json are compatibility projections from official reviewer outcomes, not independent runtime proof. Record research-source-skill.md, source-ledger.json, claim-evidence-matrix.json, novelty-ledger.json, falsification-ledger.json, research-report.md, the dated research paper, research-adversarial-review.json, research-revision-ledger.json, research-adversarial-convergence.json, research-honest-mode.json, and research-gate.json. Context7 is required only when the topic depends on current package/API/framework docs. Do not use --mock except for selftests; if live source execution is unavailable, record a blocker and keep the gate unpassed. Do not overclaim novelty, breakthrough, publication acceptance, or experimental support beyond the recorded evidence. Do not use for ordinary code edits.\n`,
    'autoresearch': `---\nname: autoresearch\ndescription: Run $sks-autoresearch for an iterative experiment loop.\n---\n\nUse for $AutoResearch or an explicit iterative experiment loop. Define program, hypothesis, experiment, metric, keep/discard, falsification, and next step. Do not become the parent identity for SEO/GEO; $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER may call research as a child stage for query, market, or competitor discovery while keeping the parent mission, gate, and Completion Proof on $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER.\n`,
    'db': `---\nname: db\ndescription: Run $sks-db for a migration or live-data safety review.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $DB/$db, or when the selected work is a migration, live-data access plan, or database-safety review. The route automatically materializes db-safety-scan.json and db-review.json plus db-access-candidates.json, db-access-review.json, code-structure-report.json, and engineering-sanity-review.json; there is no public CLI database subcommand. Inspect existing DB entry points and real callers first, then bind db-access-review.json to the generated candidate scan. Reuse the canonical adapter/query helper and prove one owned pool/client lifecycle, bounded acquire/release/shutdown/reconnect behavior, N+1/repeated-I/O review, and transaction/rollback/error propagation/idempotency/post-commit invariants for sensitive, payment, ledger, or multi-step mutations. Outside MAD-SKS, never mutate a live database: if a migration is needed, finish with exactly one mission-local manual-migration.sql containing active forward SQL and a complete rollback section that stays commented out, record its SHA-256, and tell the user to apply it manually and run rollback separately only if needed. When $MAD-SKS is explicitly combined with $DB, route directly to the bound capability-v2 SQL-plane MCP instead of generating a manual file; use \`sks mad-sks plan|sql|apply-migration\` for the explicit SQL-plane lifecycle and require independent read-back, capability close, and read-only restoration.\n`,
    'mad-sks': `---\nname: mad-sks\ndescription: Use $sks-mad-sks only for explicit high-risk SQL or grants.\n---\n\nUse only when the user explicitly invokes $MAD-SKS, top-level sks --mad, or \`sks mad-sks plan|run|apply|sql|apply-migration|status|close|rollback-apply\`. MAD-SKS is the single high-risk route for scoped permission widening and bound SQL-plane execution. It can be combined with another route, such as $MAD-SKS $Naruto or $DB ... $MAD-SKS; in that case the other command remains the primary workflow and MAD-SKS is the temporary permission grant or SQL-plane executor. The widened permission applies only while the active mission gate is open, must be deactivated when the task ends, and can open approved scopes such as target-project file writes, shell commands, package installs, local service control, network operations, browser/Computer Use workflows, generated assets, file permissions, migrations, Supabase MCP database writes, column/schema cleanup, direct execute SQL, and normal targeted DB writes.\n\nSQL-plane policy:\n${canonicalMadSksSqlPlanePolicy}\n\nCatastrophic SQL boundary: TRUNCATE, all-row UPDATE/DELETE, table/schema/database DROP, and equivalent reset operations are allowed only through the SQL-plane executor and only when the user's prompt or CLI SQL statement literally names that operation. Other MAD-SKS executors, including db-write, keep those catastrophic categories blocked. Whole database/schema/table removal outside SQL-plane, dangerous project/branch management, credential exfiltration, persistent security weakening, destructive delete without explicit confirmation, and unrequested fallback implementation remain blocked. Do not carry MAD-SKS permission into later prompts or routes. The permission profile source is centralized in src/core/permission-gates.ts and emitted as dist/core/permission-gates.js so skill/hook/MCP-style gates share one decision function.\n`,
    'gx': `---\nname: gx\ndescription: Run $sks-gx to render or validate a GX visual cartridge.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $GX/$gx or asks for architecture/context visualization through SKS. Prefer sks gx init, render, validate, drift, and snapshot. vgraph.json remains the source of truth.\n`,
    'help': `---\nname: help\ndescription: Explain installed SKS commands via $sks-help.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Help/$help or asks what commands exist. Prefer concise output from sks commands, sks usage <topic>, sks quickstart, sks aliases, and sks codex-app.\n`,
    'prompt-pipeline': `---\nname: prompt-pipeline\ndescription: Route an execution request; Answer and DFix stay light.\n---\n\nClassify only the route and the constraints that change execution. Answer handles real information requests; DFix handles tiny copy/config/docs/labels/spacing/translation/mechanical edits. Answer and tiny DFix stay parent-owned. Naruto implementation is parent orchestration: spawn disjoint slices and do not implement them in the parent thread; the PreToolUse gate denies parent source edits until the first child starts and while children are running. Preserve the literal user request; TriWiki may enrich it but never replace an explicit requirement. ${coreEngineeringDirectiveReferenceText()} For code work, identify the requested outcome, actual code/data flow, exact write scope, acceptance criteria, and the smallest meaningful verification. Load route-specific Design, PPT, image, browser, research, DB, release, or Context7 rules only when that route or external contract requires them. Materialize pipeline-plan.json with route, scopes, verification, and blockers, then finish the requested work instead of stopping at the plan.\n`,
    [SOLUTION_SCOUT_SKILL_NAME]: `---\nname: ${SOLUTION_SCOUT_SKILL_NAME}\ndescription: Scout external precedent only when the local path needs it.\n---\n\nUse only when the user asks for similar cases or when a package, API, platform, or externally documented behavior makes outside precedent materially useful. Search with the concrete symptom and current stack, prefer primary sources, and keep the local code path authoritative. Do not add this step to ordinary local bugfixes. If external evidence is unavailable, record that gap instead of inventing a workaround.\n`,
    'reasoning-router': `---\nname: reasoning-router\ndescription: Inspect reasoning hints; keep the user's Codex settings.\n---\n\nUse the active Codex model catalog for supported reasoning efforts. Task hints are advisory: do not override the selected model, effort, or service tier or persist profile changes without a request. Inspect with sks reasoning and sks pipeline status. When Jev mode is on, each new child spawn is sealed by Jev and must not be replaced with a parent-chosen model. Off mode uses the deep-tier model. A user role preference stays authoritative.\n`,
    'pipeline-runner': `---\nname: pipeline-runner\ndescription: Execute the selected SKS route with bounded evidence.\n---\n\nEvery $ command selects a route. Use current.json, mission artifacts, and pipeline-plan.json as bounded execution state; load only the selected route skill. ${coreEngineeringDirectiveReferenceText()} Codex native /goal is the only persisted goal owner. When the route requires official Codex subagents, the parent decomposes, spawns children, waits, and owns integration and verification without implementing slice work itself; use bounded TriWiki context, fetch current external docs only when relevant, record real blockers, and finish with a completion summary that states what was verified and what remains. Reflection and Honest Mode sections are strict-profile requirements only.\n`,
    'context7-docs': `---\nname: context7-docs\ndescription: Fetch Context7 docs when an external library contract matters.\n---\n\nWhen an external library, framework, API, MCP, or generated-docs contract matters, resolve-library-id, then query-docs for the resolved id. Legacy get-library-docs evidence is accepted. Prefer sks context7 tools/resolve/docs/evidence and finish only after both evidence stages exist. Check setup with sks context7 check.\n`,
    'super-search': `---\nname: super-search\ndescription: Run $sks-super-search for provider-independent source proof.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Super-Search or asks for provider-independent source proof, X-search collection, or URL acquisition. Prefer \`sks super-search doctor --json\` for readiness and \`sks super-search run "<query>" --mode balanced --json\` for provider-independent source proof; use \`sks super-search x "<query>" --json\` for X-search intent and \`sks super-search fetch "<url>" --json\` for URL acquisition. Context7 is required only when the query depends on current package/API/framework/MCP/generated documentation behavior. Provider-specific credentials are optional and must not be required for route readiness. Evidence/artifacts remain under \`.sneakoscope/missions/<super-search-* or route mission>/super-search/\`: intent.json, axes.json, query-variants.json, provider-plan.json, source-ledger.json, lead-ledger.json, claim-ledger.json, attempt-ledger.json, synthesis.md, super-search-proof.json, super-search-gate.json, and super-search-result.json. Do not turn weak discovery into supported claims; finish with an Honest Mode summary of verified sources, blockers, and unverified external coverage.\n`,
    'search-visibility-core': `---\nname: search-visibility-core\ndescription: Shared SEO/GEO kernel for $sks-seo-geo-optimizer evidence.\n---\n\nPurpose: keep Search Engine Optimization and Generative Engine Optimization on one typed search-visibility kernel instead of duplicate implementations. Use when $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER or \`sks seo-geo-optimizer\` is selected. Workflow: doctor detects package/static/Next evidence; audit writes source-backed inventory and findings; plan compiles safe mutation operations; apply requires explicit \`--apply\`; verify separates source, build, HTTP, browser, production, and measured outcome; rollback only reverses mission-owned operations. Safety: default read-only, never overwrite unmanaged robots.txt, sitemap, llms.txt, metadata, or structured data; do not hard-code customer routes; do not invent prices, reviews, availability, rankings, traffic, or AI citation outcomes. Evidence/artifacts: search-visibility/intake.json, adapter-detection.json, site-inventory.json, route-graph.json, robots-policy.json, structured-data-ledger.json, mutation-plan.json, mutation-journal.jsonl, rollback-manifest.json, verification-report.json, route gate, and completion-proof.json. Failure/recovery: unsupported frameworks stay audit/plan-only; missing production/browser/Search Console evidence remains unverified, not fabricated. CLI entrypoint: \`sks seo-geo-optimizer ... --mode seo|geo\`.\n`,
    'seo-geo-optimizer': `---\nname: seo-geo-optimizer\ndescription: Run $sks-seo-geo-optimizer for SEO or GEO visibility work.\n---\n\nPurpose: use one route name for SEO and GEO work while keeping the internal search-visibility mode explicit. Use when: the user asks for SEO audit/fix/verification, package/npm/GitHub search visibility, canonical, sitemap, robots.txt, hreflang, metadata, structured data, AI answer visibility, LLM citation readiness, answerability, entity/claim provenance, crawler policy, OAI-SearchBot/GPTBot/ChatGPT-User, Claude-SearchBot/ClaudeBot/Claude-User, or optional llms.txt planning. GEO means Generative Engine Optimization, not geolocation, GeoIP, maps, CDN geography, location permission, or regional redirect bugs. Workflow: run \`sks seo-geo-optimizer doctor --mode seo|geo\`, then audit, plan, explicit apply, verify, status, and rollback. Use \`--mode seo\` for technical/package search optimization and \`--mode geo\` for entity facts, claim evidence, answerability, crawler policy, and optional llms.txt. Safety: audit and plan must not mutate source; apply checks base hashes, ownership, scope, protected paths, rollback manifest, and post-verify. AI crawler policy must split search, training, user-directed retrieval, and ads/other; never use one allow_ai toggle and never auto-allow training crawlers. Evidence/artifacts: site-inventory.json, route-graph.json, seo-findings.json or geo-findings.json, entity-facts.json, claim-evidence-ledger.json, answerability-report.json, ai-crawler-policy.json, llms-txt-plan.json, mutation-plan.json, verification-report.json, seo-gate.json or geo-gate.json, completion-proof.json. Failure/recovery: unsupported frameworks stay plan-only; browser/production/Search Console/analytics outcomes are marked unverified when not actually run. Forbidden claims: no ranking, indexing, traffic lift, rich-result, answer inclusion, or AI citation guarantee; no keyword stuffing, doorway pages, fake reviews, fake prices, fake availability, fake shipping, fake awards, hidden AI-only text, or scaled spam.

Do not claim completion beyond evidence. In the essential profile this is a tool the user reaches for, not a gate every finish must pass; in the strict profile full routes still pass reflection-gate.json first and end with a concise SKS Honest Mode (솔직모드) section.\n`,

Codex host capabilities: ${CODEX_APP_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}. Do not equate a file in generated_images or a model name in a prompt with evidence of the engine used.

For the custom mode, list OpenRouter image models with \`sks imagegen models --refresh --json\` and compare each model's accepted aspect ratios, qualities, output formats, and reference-image limit; a model that takes no reference image cannot edit images. For Codex default, read ${CODEX_APP_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}; the built-in tool has no model selector. Report exact model ids, what each accepts, and the date checked.
