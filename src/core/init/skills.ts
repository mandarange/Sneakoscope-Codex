Promote code-changing work to Naruto unless Answer/DFix/Help/Wiki/safety route fits.

    'plan': `---\nname: plan\ndescription: Plan scaffold only - writes a fixed-template .sneakoscope/plans/<slug>.md, never touches code. Not project-specific decision-complete planning. 예: $Plan "결제 모듈 리팩터"\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Plan or asks for a plan-only frontdoor. Produce a concrete plan artifact under .sneakoscope/plans/<slug>.md with goal, scope, files to inspect, implementation steps, acceptance checks, and rollback notes. Do not edit product/source files, generated harness files, package metadata, or docs beyond the plan artifact. Keep implementation_allowed=false and hand off execution to $Work only after the user or route explicitly moves from planning to work. Finish with what is planned, what remains unimplemented, and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'work': `---\nname: work\ndescription: Execute the latest plan with evidence-gated completion. 예: $Work\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Work or asks to execute the latest SKS plan. Resolve the newest .sneakoscope/plans/*.md, route execution through Naruto evidence gates, keep leases and verification artifacts current, and do not claim completion without machine evidence or explicit blocker evidence. If no plan exists, block with a clear next action: run $Plan first or provide a task.\n`,
    'review': `---\nname: review\ndescription: Parallel diff review with machine-evidence first findings. 예: $Review 또는 sks review --staged\n---\n\nUse when the user asks for $Review or sks review. Review the selected diff read-only unless --fix is explicitly supplied. Machine evidence such as TypeScript, lint, tests, conflict markers, or secret scans outranks LLM findings and must be tagged evidence: machine; judgment-only findings must be tagged evidence: llm. --fix may attempt at most one machine-evidence fix pass and must re-run verification once. Do not mutate code for LLM-only opinions.\n`,
    'fast-mode': `---\nname: fast-mode\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $Fast-Mode, $Fast-On, and $Fast-Off global Codex Desktop Fast mode toggles.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Fast-Mode, $Fast-On, $Fast-Off, or asks to turn SKS Fast mode on/off. Prefer \`sks fast-mode on|off|status|clear --json\`. By default on/off updates the global Codex Desktop config so GPT 5.5 Fast persists and also keeps .sneakoscope/state/fast-mode.json in sync for SKS workers. Use \`--project\` only when the user explicitly wants project-local worker preference without touching global Codex config. Explicit runtime flags still win: \`--fast\`, \`--no-fast\`, and \`--service-tier standard|fast\` override the saved preference for that run. Finish with a short status and Honest Mode; do not start Naruto or broad implementation for a toggle-only request.\n`,
    'fast-on': `---\nname: fast-on\ndescription: Alias for $Fast-On global Codex Desktop GPT 5.5 Fast enablement.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as fast-mode. Run or instruct \`sks fast-mode on --json\`, then report Global (desktop), Project (sks workers), state file, and the fact that explicit per-run flags still override the saved preference.\n`,
    'fast-off': `---\nname: fast-off\ndescription: Alias for $Fast-Off global Codex Desktop Fast mode disablement.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as fast-mode.

    'with-local-llm-on': `---\nname: with-local-llm-on\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $with-local-llm-on local Ollama worker enablement.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $with-local-llm-on or asks to enable the optional local Ollama worker backend. Prefer \`sks with-local-llm on --json\`. The command writes the machine-local config at \`~/.sneakoscope/local-model.json\`. Default off means SKS stays GPT-only until this command enables local workers. Enabled mode only lets policy-eligible simple code patch-envelope or read-only collection worker slices use Ollama; GPT/Codex still owns strategy, planning, design, review, verification, safety, and integration. \`--no-ollama\` and \`SKS_OLLAMA_WORKERS=0\` still force local workers off for a run. Finish with a short status and Honest Mode; do not start Naruto for a toggle-only request.\n`,
    'with-local-llm-off': `---\nname: with-local-llm-off\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $with-local-llm-off local Ollama worker disablement.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $with-local-llm-off or asks to disable the optional local Ollama worker backend. Prefer \`sks with-local-llm off --json\`. The command writes the machine-local config at \`~/.sneakoscope/local-model.json\`. Disabled mode keeps SKS GPT-only by default. Strategy, planning, design, review, verification, safety, and integration remain GPT/Codex-owned regardless of this toggle. Finish with a short status and Honest Mode; do not start Naruto for a toggle-only request.\n`,
    'wiki': `---\nname: wiki\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $Wiki TriWiki refresh, pack, validate, and prune commands.\n---\n\nUse for $Wiki or Korean wiki-refresh requests. Refresh/update/갱신: run sks wiki refresh, then validate .sneakoscope/wiki/context-pack.json. Pack: run sks wiki pack, then validate. Prune/clean/정리: use sks wiki refresh --prune, or sks wiki prune --dry-run for inspection. Report claims, anchors, trust, attention.use_first/hydrate_first, validation, and blockers. Do not start ambiguity-gated implementation, subagents, or unrelated work.\n`,
    'from-chat-img': `---\nname: from-chat-img\ndescription: Explicit $From-Chat-IMG Naruto add-on gate for chat screenshot plus attachment analysis.\n---\n\nUse only for From-Chat-IMG/$From-Chat-IMG. It enters the Naruto pipeline with from_chat_img_required=true and an add-on coverage gate. Treat uploads as chat screenshot plus originals. For web/browser/webapp targets use Codex Chrome Extension first; for native Mac/non-web app surfaces use Codex Computer Use visual inspection when available. List requirements first, match regions to attachments with confidence, write ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_COVERAGE_ARTIFACT}, ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_CHECKLIST_ARTIFACT}, ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_ARTIFACT}, and ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_QA_LOOP_ARTIFACT}, then continue Naruto worker proof, review, reflection, and Honest Mode. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY} The ledger must account for every visible customer request, screenshot image region, and separate attachment; ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_CHECKLIST_ARTIFACT} must have a checked item for each request, image-region/attachment match, work item, scoped QA-LOOP, and verification step; ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_ARTIFACT} stores temporary TriWiki-backed session context with expires_after_sessions=${FROM_CHAT_IMG_TEMP_TRIWIKI_SESSIONS}. ${FROM_CHAT_IMG_QA_LOOP_ARTIFACT} must prove QA-LOOP ran over the exact customer-request work-order range after implementation, with every work item covered, post-fix verification complete, and zero unresolved findings. naruto-gate.json cannot pass From-Chat-IMG completion until from_chat_img_request_coverage=true, unresolved_items is empty, every checklist box is checked, and scoped_qa_loop_completed=true.\n`,
    'qa-loop': `---\nname: qa-loop\ndescription: $QA-LOOP dogfoods UI/API as human proxy with safety gates, Codex Chrome Extension-first web UI evidence, safe fixes, rechecks, and a QA report.\n---\n\nUse only $QA-LOOP. Infer scope, target, mutation policy, and login boundary from the prompt plus TriWiki/current-code defaults; do not surface a prequestion sheet. Credentials are runtime-only; never save secrets. Web/browser/webapp UI-level E2E must run the Codex Chrome Extension readiness gate first; if the extension is missing or disabled, rapidly halt and ask the user to set it up, then resume only after the user confirms installation is complete. Codex Computer Use is reserved for native Mac/non-web surfaces and must not satisfy web UI evidence. Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer, Browser Use, Chrome MCP, screenshots fabricated from code, and prose-only checks do not satisfy web UI/browser verification. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} Deployed targets are read-only; destructive removal is forbidden. After answer/run, dogfood real flows, apply safe contract-allowed code/test/docs fixes, recheck, and do not pass qa-gate.json with unresolved findings or without post_fix_verification_complete. Finish qa-ledger, date/version report, gate, completion summary, and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'ppt': `---\nname: ppt\ndescription: $PPT information-first HTML/PDF presentation pipeline with inferred STP, audience, pain-point, format, research, design-system, and verification contract.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $PPT or asks to create a presentation, deck, slides, pitch deck, proposal deck, HTML presentation, or PDF presentation artifact. Before artifact work, auto-seal presentation-specific answers from prompt, TriWiki/current-code defaults, and conservative policy: delivery context, target audience profile including role/average age/job/industry/topic familiarity/decision power, STP strategy, decision context and objections, and 3+ pain-point to solution mappings with expected aha moments. Do not surface a prequestion sheet. Presentation design must be simple, restrained, and information-first: avoid over-designed decoration, ornamental gradients, nested cards, and effects that compete with the message. Design detail should be embedded through typography hierarchy, spacing, alignment, thin rules, source clarity, and subtle accents. ${pptPipelineAllowlistPolicyText()} Use Product Design plugin first for context, ideation, prototype direction, audit, design QA, and share handoff. Use design.md only as an existing project-local cache or fallback SSOT when Product Design is unavailable; if fallback creation is needed, use docs/Design-Sys-Prompt.md plus getdesign-reference and curated DESIGN.md examples from ${AWESOME_DESIGN_MD_REFERENCE.url} only as source inputs, then fuse them into route-local PPT style tokens with a recorded design_ssot instead of treating references as parallel authorities. The $PPT route always loads imagegen as a required skill, checks Codex App imagegen at route start, and runs SKS auto-repair once before any image-dependent build/review work. If repair fails, stop with codex_imagegen_unavailable and do not continue with image-free or API-substituted evidence. When the sealed contract needs a generated raster asset or generated slide visual critique, immediately invoke Codex App \`$imagegen\` with gpt-image-2, move/copy the selected output into the mission assets or review evidence path, and record the real file path in ppt-image-asset-ledger.json or ppt-review-ledger.json before building or passing the gate. Direct API fallback, placeholder files, HTML/CSS stand-ins, and prose-only substitutes do not satisfy the route gate. ${productDesignPluginPolicyText()} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY} Use web or Context7 evidence only when external facts/libraries/current docs are required by the PPT contract, record verified claims in ppt-fact-ledger.json, record generated image asset plans/results/blockers in ppt-image-asset-ledger.json, then create the PDF plus editable source HTML under source-html/, keep independent strategy/render/file-write phases parallel where inputs allow, record ppt-parallel-report.json, run the bounded ppt-review-policy/ppt-review-ledger/ppt-iteration-report loop, and verify readability, overlap, format fit, source coverage, export state, unsupported-claim status, image-asset completion, review-loop termination, and temporary build files cleanup. Finish with reflection and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'computer-use-fast': `---\nname: computer-use-fast\ndescription: Alias for the maximum-speed $Computer-Use/$CU native Codex Computer Use lane.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as computer-use: skip Naruto delegation, QA-LOOP clarification, upfront TriWiki refresh, Context7, subagents, and reflection unless explicitly requested. Use Codex Computer Use directly only for native macOS, desktop-app, OS-settings, or non-web visual tasks. Browser, localhost, website, webapp, and web-based app verification must use the Codex Chrome Extension path first and must halt if that extension is not installed/enabled. At the end only, refresh/pack TriWiki, validate it, then provide a concise completion summary plus Honest Mode. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY}\n`,
    'cu': `---\nname: cu\ndescription: Short alias for the maximum-speed native $Computer-Use Codex Computer Use lane.\n---\n\nUse the same rules as computer-use. This is a speed lane for native macOS, desktop-app, OS-settings, and non-web visual tasks requiring Codex Computer Use evidence, with TriWiki refresh/validate and Honest Mode deferred to final closeout. Web/browser/webapp verification must use Codex Chrome Extension first and stop if the extension is not installed/enabled. ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY}\n`,
    'goal': `---\nname: goal\ndescription: Codex-native $Goal/$goal control with detailed completion criteria and no SKS-owned Goal state.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Goal/$goal or asks to create, edit, view, pause, resume, or clear a persisted goal. Use only Codex native Goal controls or the callable native goal tool. Do not run sks goal, create an SKS mission, write bridge artifacts, compile a compatibility loop, create fallback Goal state, refresh TriWiki, or open subagents for the Goal control turn. Before create or edit, expand the request into explicit Outcome, Scope, Constraints, Verification, Done when, Stop conditions, and Non-goals. Completion criteria must be measurable and must stop work once satisfied; forbid unrelated refactors, speculative expansion, and open-ended polishing. If native Goal is unavailable, report that limitation instead of substituting an SKS implementation.\n`,
    'release-review': `---\nname: release-review\ndescription: Official Codex subagent release review route for $Release-Review.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Release-Review or asks for a release-readiness review. Run it through \`sks naruto run \"$Release-Review release audit\" --agents <n> --read-only --json\` or the current Codex parent session. The parent owns decomposition, waits for every official worker/expert thread, integrates one structured outcome per thread, and records subagent-plan.json, subagent-events.jsonl, subagent-parent-summary.json, and subagent-evidence.json. No alternate Release-Review runtime is supported. Finish with release-readiness verification and Honest Mode.\n`,
    'commit': `---\nname: commit\ndescription: Simple git-only route for $Commit requests that stage current changes and create one commit without the full SKS pipeline.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Commit or explicitly asks to commit the current repository changes without pushing. Keep this route lightweight: inspect git status and the relevant diff summary, avoid Naruto/pipeline/TriWiki route work unless separately requested, stage the intended current changes, and create one git commit. The commit message must summarize the actual work and include exactly one trailer: Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>. Do not push. If there are no changes, report that no commit was created. Finish with a concise result and a one-line Honest Mode covering the commit hash and any unverified items.\n`,
    'commit-and-push': `---\nname: commit-and-push\ndescription: Simple git-only route for $Commit-And-Push requests that stage current changes, create one commit, and push without the full SKS pipeline.\n---\n\nUse only when the user invokes $Commit-And-Push or explicitly asks to commit and push the current repository changes. Keep this route lightweight: inspect git status and the relevant diff summary, avoid Naruto/pipeline/TriWiki route work unless separately requested, stage the intended current changes, create one git commit, then push the current branch. The commit message must summarize the actual work and include exactly one trailer: Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>. If there are no changes, do not create an empty commit unless the user explicitly asks for one. Finish with a concise result and a one-line Honest Mode covering the commit hash, pushed branch, and any unverified items.\n`,
    'research': `---\nname: research\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $Research or $research frontier discovery workflows.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Research/$research or asks for research, hypotheses, new mechanisms, falsification, or testable predictions. Prefer sks research prepare and sks research run. Research is not an implementation route: do not edit repository source, docs, package metadata, generated skills, or harness files; write only route-local mission artifacts under .sneakoscope/missions/<mission-id>/. First run layered Super Search across current papers, primary/official sources, standards, public discourse, practitioner evidence, background sources, and explicit counterevidence; only verified-content source rows may support real-run reviewer claims. Then run exactly three independent official Codex subagent threads using the project custom agent research_reviewer with GPT-5.6 Sol Max: Einstein Agent (first principles, explanation, experiments), von Neumann Agent (formal systems, algorithms, strategy, scaling), and Skeptic Agent (counterevidence, base rates, replication). These are composite persona-inspired lenses, not impersonations. Do not launch a custom debate scheduler, worker pool, or synthetic model fanout. Each reviewer must return the structured adversarial outcome, one literal "Eureka!" idea, source ids, falsifiers, cheap probes, and zero unresolved objections before approval. If any reviewer requests revision, revise the manuscript and run a fresh three-thread review cycle within the bounded cycle cap; convergence requires unanimous approval and trustworthy parent outcomes for all threads. agent-ledger.json and debate-ledger.json are compatibility projections from official reviewer outcomes, not independent runtime proof. Record research-source-skill.md, source-ledger.json, claim-evidence-matrix.json, novelty-ledger.json, falsification-ledger.json, research-report.md, the dated research paper, research-adversarial-review.json, research-revision-ledger.json, research-adversarial-convergence.json, genius-opinion-summary.md, research-honest-mode.json, and research-gate.json. Context7 is required only when the topic depends on current package/API/framework docs. Do not use --mock except for selftests; if live source execution is unavailable, record a blocker and keep the gate unpassed. Do not use for ordinary code edits.\n`,
    'autoresearch': `---\nname: autoresearch\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $AutoResearch or $autoresearch iterative experiment loops.\n---\n\nUse for $AutoResearch, iterative improvement, ranking, workflow, benchmark, or experiments. Define program, hypothesis, experiment, metric, keep/discard, falsification, next step, and Honest Mode. Do not become the parent identity for SEO/GEO; $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER may call research as a child stage for query, market, or competitor discovery while keeping the parent mission, gate, and Completion Proof on $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER.\n`,
    'db': `---\nname: db\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $DB or $db database and Supabase safety checks.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $DB/$db or the task touches SQL, Supabase, Postgres, migrations, Prisma, Drizzle, Knex, MCP database tools, or production data. The $DB route automatically materializes db-safety-scan.json and db-review.json from the internal DB safety engine; inspect those artifacts and current source/docs evidence directly. Keep analysis read-only by default. Destructive database operations remain forbidden; explicitly authorized SQL-plane work uses sks mad-sks plan|sql|apply-migration under an active scoped permission mission.\n`,
    'mad-sks': `---\nname: mad-sks\ndescription: Explicit high-risk authorization modifier plus SQL-plane executor for $MAD-SKS.\n---\n\nUse only when the user explicitly invokes $MAD-SKS, top-level sks --mad, or \`sks mad-sks plan|run|apply|sql|apply-migration|status|close|rollback-apply\`. MAD-SKS is the single high-risk route for scoped permission widening and bound SQL-plane execution. It can be combined with another route, such as $MAD-SKS $Naruto or $DB ... $MAD-SKS; in that case the other command remains the primary workflow and MAD-SKS is the temporary permission grant or SQL-plane executor. The widened permission applies only while the active mission gate is open, must be deactivated when the task ends, and can open approved scopes such as target-project file writes, shell commands, package installs, local service control, network operations, browser/Computer Use workflows, generated assets, file permissions, migrations, Supabase MCP database writes, column/schema cleanup, direct execute SQL, and normal targeted DB writes.\n\nSQL-plane policy:\n${canonicalMadSksSqlPlanePolicy}\n\nCatastrophic SQL boundary: TRUNCATE, all-row UPDATE/DELETE, table/schema/database DROP, and equivalent reset operations are allowed only through the SQL-plane executor and only when the user's prompt or CLI SQL statement literally names that operation. Other MAD-SKS executors, including db-write, keep those catastrophic categories blocked. Whole database/schema/table removal outside SQL-plane, dangerous project/branch management, credential exfiltration, persistent security weakening, destructive delete without explicit confirmation, and unrequested fallback implementation remain blocked. Do not carry MAD-SKS permission into later prompts or routes. The permission profile source is centralized in src/core/permission-gates.ts and emitted as dist/core/permission-gates.js so skill/hook/MCP-style gates share one decision function.\n`,
    'gx': `---\nname: gx\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $GX or $gx deterministic GX visual context cartridges.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $GX/$gx or asks for architecture/context visualization through SKS. Prefer sks gx init, render, validate, drift, and snapshot. vgraph.json remains the source of truth.\n`,
    'help': `---\nname: help\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $Help or $help explaining installed SKS commands and workflows.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Help/$help or asks what commands exist. Prefer concise output from sks commands, sks usage <topic>, sks quickstart, sks aliases, and sks codex-app.\n`,
    'prompt-pipeline': `---\nname: prompt-pipeline\ndescription: Default SKS prompt routing for execution requests; Answer and DFix remain lightweight.\n---\n\nClassify only the route and the constraints that change execution. Answer handles real information requests; DFix handles tiny copy/config/docs/labels/spacing/translation/mechanical edits; general code-changing work uses Naruto with Codex official subagents. Preserve the literal user request; TriWiki may enrich it but never replace an explicit requirement. ${coreEngineeringDirectiveReferenceText()} For code work, identify the requested outcome, actual code/data flow, exact write scope, acceptance criteria, and the smallest meaningful verification. Load route-specific Design, PPT, image, browser, research, DB, release, or Context7 rules only when that route or external contract requires them. Materialize pipeline-plan.json with route, scopes, verification, and blockers, then finish the requested work instead of stopping at the plan.\n`,
    [SOLUTION_SCOUT_SKILL_NAME]: `---\nname: ${SOLUTION_SCOUT_SKILL_NAME}\ndescription: Optional source scout for fixes that materially depend on external precedent.\n---\n\nUse only when the user asks for similar cases or when a package, API, platform, or externally documented behavior makes outside precedent materially useful. Search with the concrete symptom and current stack, prefer primary sources, and keep the local code path authoritative. Do not add this step to ordinary local bugfixes. If external evidence is unavailable, record that gap instead of inventing a workaround.\n`,
    'reasoning-router': `---\nname: reasoning-router\ndescription: Temporary SKS reasoning-effort routing for every command and pipeline route.\n---\n\nmedium: simple copy/color/discovery/setup/mechanical edits. high: logic, safety, architecture, DB, orchestration, refactor, multi-file work. xhigh: research, AutoResearch, falsification, benchmarks, SEO/GEO, open-ended discovery, and From-Chat-IMG image work-order analysis. Routing is temporary; return to default after the gate. Inspect with sks reasoning and sks pipeline status.\n`,
    'pipeline-runner': `---\nname: pipeline-runner\ndescription: Execute SKS routes with bounded state, evidence, reflection, and Honest Mode.\n---\n\nEvery $ command selects a route. Use current.json, mission artifacts, and pipeline-plan.json as bounded execution state; load only the selected route skill. ${coreEngineeringDirectiveReferenceText()} Codex native /goal is the only persisted goal owner. Use official Codex subagents only when the route requires independent slices, keep parent-owned integration, use bounded TriWiki context, fetch current external docs only when relevant, record real blockers, refresh and validate evidence, run reflection for full routes, and finish with a completion summary plus Honest Mode.\n`,
    'context7-docs': `---\nname: context7-docs\ndescription: Enforce Context7 MCP documentation evidence for SKS routes that depend on external libraries, frameworks, APIs, MCPs, package managers, DB SDKs, or generated docs.\n---\n\nWhen required, resolve-library-id, then query-docs for the resolved id. Legacy get-library-docs evidence is accepted. Prefer sks context7 tools/resolve/docs/evidence and finish only after both evidence stages exist. Check setup with sks context7 check.\n`,
    'super-search': `---\nname: super-search\ndescription: Dollar-command route for $Super-Search provider-independent source intelligence.\n---\n\nUse when the user invokes $Super-Search or asks for Super-Search source intelligence, source acquisition, X-search-style collection, URL acquisition, source normalization, claim ledgers, or citation proof. Prefer \`sks super-search doctor --json\` for readiness and \`sks super-search run "<query>" --mode balanced --json\` for provider-independent source proof; use \`sks super-search x "<query>" --json\` for X-search intent and \`sks super-search fetch "<url>" --json\` for URL acquisition. Context7 is required only when the query depends on current package/API/framework/MCP/generated documentation behavior. Provider-specific credentials are optional and must not be required for route readiness. Evidence/artifacts remain under \`.sneakoscope/missions/<super-search-* or route mission>/super-search/\`: intent.json, axes.json, query-variants.json, provider-plan.json, source-ledger.json, lead-ledger.json, claim-ledger.json, attempt-ledger.json, synthesis.md, super-search-proof.json, super-search-gate.json, and super-search-result.json. Do not turn weak discovery into supported claims; finish with an Honest Mode summary of verified sources, blockers, and unverified external coverage.\n`,
    'search-visibility-core': `---\nname: search-visibility-core\ndescription: Shared kernel for seo-geo-optimizer audit, plan, explicit apply, rollback, verification, gates, and Completion Proof.\n---\n\nPurpose: keep Search Engine Optimization and Generative Engine Optimization on one typed search-visibility kernel instead of duplicate implementations. Use when $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER or \`sks seo-geo-optimizer\` is selected. Workflow: doctor detects package/static/Next evidence; audit writes source-backed inventory and findings; plan compiles safe mutation operations; apply requires explicit \`--apply\`; verify separates source, build, HTTP, browser, production, and measured outcome; rollback only reverses mission-owned operations. Safety: default read-only, never overwrite unmanaged robots.txt, sitemap, llms.txt, metadata, or structured data; do not hard-code customer routes; do not invent prices, reviews, availability, rankings, traffic, or AI citation outcomes. Evidence/artifacts: search-visibility/intake.json, adapter-detection.json, site-inventory.json, route-graph.json, robots-policy.json, structured-data-ledger.json, mutation-plan.json, mutation-journal.jsonl, rollback-manifest.json, verification-report.json, route gate, and completion-proof.json. Failure/recovery: unsupported frameworks stay audit/plan-only; missing production/browser/Search Console evidence remains unverified, not fabricated.

    'seo-geo-optimizer': `---\nname: seo-geo-optimizer\ndescription: Unified $SEO-GEO-OPTIMIZER route for Search Engine Optimization and Generative Engine Optimization.\n---\n\nPurpose: use one route name for SEO and GEO work while keeping the internal search-visibility mode explicit. Use when: the user asks for SEO audit/fix/verification, package/npm/GitHub search visibility, canonical, sitemap, robots.txt, hreflang, metadata, structured data, AI answer visibility, LLM citation readiness, answerability, entity/claim provenance, crawler policy, OAI-SearchBot/GPTBot/ChatGPT-User, Claude-SearchBot/ClaudeBot/Claude-User, or optional llms.txt planning. GEO means Generative Engine Optimization, not geolocation, GeoIP, maps, CDN geography, location permission, or regional redirect bugs. Workflow: run \`sks seo-geo-optimizer doctor --mode seo|geo\`, then audit, plan, explicit apply, verify, status, and rollback. Use \`--mode seo\` for technical/package search optimization and \`--mode geo\` for entity facts, claim evidence, answerability, crawler policy, and optional llms.txt. Safety: audit and plan must not mutate source; apply checks base hashes, ownership, scope, protected paths, rollback manifest, and post-verify. AI crawler policy must split search, training, user-directed retrieval, and ads/other; never use one allow_ai toggle and never auto-allow training crawlers. Evidence/artifacts: site-inventory.json, route-graph.json, seo-findings.json or geo-findings.json, entity-facts.json, claim-evidence-ledger.json, answerability-report.json, ai-crawler-policy.json, llms-txt-plan.json, mutation-plan.json, verification-report.json, seo-gate.json or geo-gate.json, completion-proof.json. Failure/recovery: unsupported frameworks stay plan-only; browser/production/Search Console/analytics outcomes are marked unverified when not actually run. Forbidden claims: no ranking, indexing, traffic lift, rich-result, answer inclusion, or AI citation guarantee; no keyword stuffing, doorway pages, fake reviews, fake prices, fake availability, fake shipping, fake awards, hidden AI-only text, or scaled spam.

Write reflection.md; append real lessons to ${REFLECTION_MEMORY_PATH}; refresh/pack, validate context-pack.json, pass reflection-gate.json.\n\n${reflectionInstructionText()}\n`,
    'honest-mode': `---\nname: honest-mode\ndescription: Required final SKS verification pass before claiming a task is complete.\n---\n\nBefore final: include a completion summary explaining what was done, what changed for the user/repo, what was verified, and what remains unverified or blocked. Then restate the goal, compare result to evidence, list tests/commands/inspections, state uncertainty or blockers plainly, and do not claim completion beyond evidence. Full routes must pass reflection-gate.json first. Include concise SKS Honest Mode or 솔직모드 when required.\n`,

Database claims must respect .sneakoscope/db-safety.json. Wiki claims should carry id, hash, source path, and RGBA/trig coordinate anchors so they can be hydrated instead of treated as unsupported summaries.\n`,

    'gx-visual-generate': `---\nname: gx-visual-generate\ndescription: Render a deterministic SVG/HTML visual sheet from vgraph.json and beta.json.\n---\n\nUse sks gx render. vgraph.json is source of truth; renders embed source hash and RGBA wiki anchors.\n`,
    'gx-visual-read': `---\nname: gx-visual-read\ndescription: Read a Sneakoscope Codex deterministic visual sheet and produce context notes.\n---\n\nExtract nodes, edges, invariants, tests, risks, uncertainties, and RGBA anchors from source/render/snapshot. Do not infer hidden nodes.\n`,

    'research-discovery': `---\nname: research-discovery\ndescription: Run SKS Research Mode for frontier-style research, hypotheses, novelty ledgers, falsification, and experiments.\n---\n\nFrame criteria, map assumptions, and run layered Super Search before synthesis. Use exactly three independent official research_reviewer threads on GPT-5.6 Sol Max: Einstein Agent for first-principles explanation and experiments, von Neumann Agent for formal systems/algorithms/strategy, and Skeptic Agent for counterevidence/base rates/replication. Treat them as composite persona-inspired lenses, never impersonations. Require structured source-bound outcomes, one literal "Eureka!" idea per reviewer, falsifiers, cheap probes, and unanimous zero-objection approval. Revise and rerun a fresh three-thread cycle when challenged; do not use the removed custom debate scheduler. Keep agent/debate ledgers as compatibility projections only and do not overclaim genius, novelty, breakthrough, or publication acceptance.\n`,
    'performance-evaluator': `---\nname: performance-evaluator\ndescription: Evaluate SKS performance, evidence-backed token usage, serialized-size proxies, accuracy-proxy, context-compression, or workflow improvements.\n---\n\nUse sks eval run/compare before claims. Treat serialized_size_bytes as a deterministic non-token proxy. Claim token savings only when actual baseline and candidate token counts include an evidence source; otherwise report token savings as not measured. Report accuracy_delta/proxy, required_recall, support, and meaningful_improvement without substituting proxy size for token evidence.\n`,

Prefer the official Codex App built-in image generation feature documented at ${CODEX_APP_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}: ask naturally or invoke \`$imagegen\`. SKS route code checks capability before image-dependent routes, attempts doctor imagegen repair once, and reports codex_imagegen_unavailable if Codex App $imagegen still is not ready. For newest-model requests, make the prompt explicit: "Use ChatGPT Images 2.0 / GPT Image 2.0 with gpt-image-2." Useful official references are ${OPENAI_CHATGPT_IMAGES_2_DOC_URL}, ${OPENAI_GPT_IMAGE_2_MODEL_DOC_URL}, and ${OPENAI_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}. Codex App image generation counts against Codex usage limits. Capability detection is not output proof; full SKS evidence requires a real selected raster output path or generated review image artifact. Direct OpenAI API fallback is non-Codex evidence and does not satisfy SKS route evidence unless a separate non-Codex API task is explicitly requested. ${IMAGEGEN_SOCIAL_SOURCE_POLICY} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY} Do not substitute placeholder SVG/HTML/CSS for requested raster assets; follow design.md when relevant.\n`,

Source order: official OpenAI announcement (${OPENAI_CHATGPT_IMAGES_2_DOC_URL}), Codex App image generation docs (${CODEX_APP_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}), gpt-image-2 model docs (${OPENAI_GPT_IMAGE_2_MODEL_DOC_URL}), OpenAI Image Generation API docs (${OPENAI_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}), then public X/social/community search for prompt-quality heuristics only. ${IMAGEGEN_SOCIAL_SOURCE_POLICY} If social or web search is unavailable, record that social coverage is unverified and continue from official docs. Output a compact evidence split: official capability/evidence rules, prompt heuristics, social/workflow signals, and blockers.

Prefer the official Codex skill if available with \`${GETDESIGN_REFERENCE.codex_skill_install}\`.

Fuse those inputs into one design.md fallback/cache with tokens, components, states, imagery, accessibility, and verification rules; do not leave multiple design files or references as competing authorities. Use the plan tool only for real ambiguity plus default font recommendation. Use imagegen for assets. ${productDesignPluginPolicyText()} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY}\n`,
    'design-ui-editor': `---\nname: design-ui-editor\ndescription: Legacy fallback UI/UX editor for existing design.md systems when Product Design plugin is unavailable.\n---\n\nUse Product Design plugin first. When falling back, read \`design.md\`, inspect relevant UI/assets/tests, consult getdesign-reference when improving the design system, apply the smallest design-system-conformant change, use imagegen for image/logo/raster assets, and verify render quality. ${productDesignPluginPolicyText()} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY} If design.md is missing and Product Design is unavailable, use design-system-builder as fallback.\n`,

- TriWiki SSOT: .sneakoscope/wiki/context-pack.json. Use only the latest coordinate+voxel overlay pack; coordinate-only legacy packs are invalid and must be refreshed before use. Use attention.use_first for compact high-trust recall and hydrate attention.hydrate_first from source before risky/lower-trust decisions. Refresh/pack after findings or artifact changes; validate before handoffs/final claims.
- ${stackCurrentDocsPolicyText()}
- Keep non-selected claims hydratable by id, hash, source path, and RGBA/trig coordinate. Hydrate low-trust claims before relying on them.
- Hook output is limited; use mission files, official subagent events, or normal updates for live detail.
