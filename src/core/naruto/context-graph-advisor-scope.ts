/**
 * Graph mechanics for the Naruto scope advisory: bounded walks, exact seed
 * resolution, and the two closures a slice gets.
 *
 * Split out of `context-graph-advisor.ts` by role — this file knows how to read
 * the graph, that file knows what the advice means. Nothing here mutates
 * anything, spawns a process, or reads a file: every function takes a reader the
 * caller already opened, through the query facade.
 *
 * The two closures are deliberately different directions:
 *  - the *write closure* walks dependency edges downward from the paths a slice
 *    would write, which is what makes two slices collide;
 *  - the *impact closure* walks the same relations in reverse to find the tests
 *    and gates that would have to re-run.
 * A test file is a dependent, never a dependency, so it can never enter a write
 * closure and a shared suite is never reported as a write conflict.
 *
 * ## Two things the compact index changed, both reported rather than papered over
 *
 * **Label seeds no longer resolve.** Format revision 1 interns an exact table of
 * canonical node ids and a basename table of workspace-relative paths, and has no
 * label index at all. So a slice that declared only a symbol name now resolves to
 * nothing and is reported through `unresolved_seeds`, which makes the advisory
 * *conservative* — the slice is unproven rather than falsely disjoint. Guessing
 * the label through BM25F would have kept the old behaviour and violated ADR §4:
 * a text match is not a relation, and an advisory that guessed its own write
 * scope would be confidently wrong about which slices can run in parallel.
 *
 * **Metadata booleans arrive as strings.** The writer stores every metadata value
 * through `String(value)`, so `isTest: true` becomes `'true'`. `contextNodeFlag`
 * normalizes it; without that, `isTestNode` loses its metadata arm entirely and
 * test files start reading as write-scope conflicts.
