Capture or receive source UI screenshots; web/browser/webapp capture must pass the Codex Chrome Extension readiness gate first, while Computer Use is only for native Mac/non-web app surfaces. Use Product Design plugin audit/design-qa when available to structure UX issue framing, but still require the imagegen visual evidence route. Then use Codex App imagegen/$imagegen with gpt-image-2 (${CODEX_APP_IMAGE_GENERATION_DOC_URL}) to create new annotated review images from those screenshots as reference inputs. The generated review image must visibly mark numbered callouts, P0/P1/P2/P3 labels, eye-flow, hierarchy, contrast, alignment, density, affordance problems, and a small corrected mini-comp or before/after strip when useful. Then analyze that generated review image with vision/OCR and convert the visible callouts into image-ux-issue-ledger.json rows. Missing generated review images block full Image UX verification, but the route may close as verified_partial/reference-only when source screenshots plus hashes, docs evidence, source Image Voxel anchors, and Honest Mode evidence exist and the gate records that no annotated image, callout extraction, or full UX review evidence exists. Never pass this route from a direct API fallback, hand-written text-only substitute, placeholder asset, or fabricated ledger. ${productDesignPluginPolicyText()} ${CODEX_WEB_VERIFICATION_POLICY} ${CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_ONLY_POLICY} ${CODEX_IMAGEGEN_REQUIRED_POLICY}`;
