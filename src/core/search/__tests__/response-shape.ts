/**
 * A structural fingerprint of `SearchResponse`, for the CRK2 consumer migration.
 *
 * The migration replaces the engine under `searchContext`, and a new engine is
 * *supposed* to return different nodes in a different order — CRK2 finds things
 * v1 could not. What may not change is the shape every caller codes against:
 * field names, field types, and whether a field can be absent. Pinning the
 * result set instead would pin v1's behaviour, including the empty `korean` and
 * `jargon` answers the kernel exists to fix.
 *
 * ## Why a merged field map and not a per-response shape
 *
 * The obvious encoding — one shape string per response — is data-dependent in a
 * way that makes it useless here. A response whose only match happens to be a
 * symbol reports `symbol` as always present; the same query answered with a file
 * node reports it as absent. Both are the same contract. So paths are collected
 * across *every* recorded response and merged: a field observed under a parent
 * fewer times than the parent itself was observed is optional, and a field's type
 * is the union of everything seen at that path.
 *
 * The comparison this enables is the one the card actually asks for: no field
 * disappears, no field changes type, and anything new is reported rather than
 * silently accepted.
 *
 * Two object shapes here are *data*, not contract — `skipped.reasons` and
 * `context.graph.omissionReasons` are keyed by whichever omission happened. They
 * collapse to a single `*` path so that "the traversal stopped for a different
 * reason" is not reported as a broken response contract.
