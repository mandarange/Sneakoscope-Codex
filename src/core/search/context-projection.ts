/**
 * `SearchResponse` projection for the graph-backed `context` mode (CG2-13).
 *
 * Split out of `context.ts` so that file can shrink while gaining the CRK2 call
 * sequence: this module knows what an answer *looks like* to a caller, that one
 * knows how to get one. The split is also where the migration's only public
 * behaviour change lives, and it is worth stating where a reader will find it.
 *
 * ## Confidence is now the kernel's claim, not a re-reading of the last hop
 *
 * v1 derived a match's confidence by inspecting the final explanation step: a
 * `defines` hop produced `exact_definition`, an `exact`/`manifest` hop produced
 * `exact_reference`. That labelled a *traversed neighbour* with the confidence of
 * the edge that reached it, which ADR §4 says is wrong — a neighbour of an exact
 * seed is a candidate, not an exact match, and only the anchor lane may claim
 * exactness at all. The kernel already computes this correctly and demotes by hop
 * count, so the projection reports `seedConfidence` rather than re-deriving a
 * weaker rule from the hop. Nodes reached by traversal therefore read as
 * `syntactic_reference` / `text_candidate` where v1 said `exact_*`.
 *
 * `graph_relation` and `graph_relation_confidence` still carry the last hop, so
 * nothing that was visible before has been removed — it stopped being laundered
 * into the match's own confidence.
