/**
 * The mission's declared risk reaches the traversal, or it does not exist.
 *
 * `risk` was declared on the attention options, forwarded through the projection
 * and read by the kernel — and the one production caller never passed it, so
 * every mission got the profile's ordinary 2-hop traversal. A test that asserted
 * "the parameter was forwarded" is exactly the shape of test that let that live
 * for ten builds. So the property here is a *reach* property, measured on a real
 * published generation: a node that sits three hops from the seed is in a
 * high-risk mission's answer and absent from a normal one's.
 *
 * The fixture is a bare import chain and nothing else:
 *
 *   alpha/aardvark.ts -> bravo/bandicoot.ts -> charlie/capybara.ts -> delta/dugong.ts
 *
 * Three properties of that shape are load-bearing and none of them is incidental:
 *
 * - **No module nodes.** A `module` that `contains` every file would put the last
 *   file two hops from the first through the module, and the test would pass at
 *   depth 2 while proving nothing.
 * - **The query is a bare distinctive token, never the seed's path.** Querying
 *   `alpha/aardvark.ts` normalizes to the terms `alpha`, `aardvark`, `ts` — and
 *   `ts` is a basename token of *every* file in the chain, so the lexical lane
 *   seeds all four at depth 0 and both risks return the whole graph. That is not
 *   a quirk of the fixture: any path-shaped query carries its extension as a
 *   term. `aardvark` matches one node, which is what leaves the traversal as the
 *   only way to reach the rest.
 * - **`dugong` is `risk: 'low'` and reached over `imports`.** `imports` is not a
 *   safety relation, so the safety closure — which runs on every query — cannot
 *   reach it; and a low-risk node earns nothing from the doubled risk-relevance
 *   bonus. Depth is left as the only thing that can explain its appearance.
