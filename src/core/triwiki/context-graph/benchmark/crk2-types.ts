/**
 * Contracts for the Context Retrieval Kernel v2 benchmark.
 *
 * These types extend the existing benchmark framework rather than replacing it:
 * the CRK2 corpus needs a gold shape (ADR work order §13) that the v1 corpus
 * never carried — per-node must/relevant/forbidden sets, an expected error code,
 * and a confidence expectation — while recall, percentile and leak-scanning math
 * stay shared with `metrics.ts` and `floors.ts`.
 *
 * The engine arrives as an argument on every entry point here. Nothing in this
 * module reads an environment variable or a config file to decide which engine
 * answers, because a seam reachable from configuration is a fallback, and ADR §1
 * forbids fallbacks.
