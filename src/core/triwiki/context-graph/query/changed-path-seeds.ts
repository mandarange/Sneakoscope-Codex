/**
 * Caller-supplied changed paths, as kernel seeds.
 *
 * A caller that already knows which files it is working on holds evidence the
 * query text does not carry: `sks search --mode context "why did this break"`
 * says nothing about the three files in the diff, and the kernel cannot infer
 * them. v1 turned those paths into `file_path` provided seeds through
 * `search/context-graph-seeds.ts`; the v2 callers dropped the field, and the
 * measured cost was 57.7% of the v1→v2 must-include recall gap.
 *
 * ## Why this is allowed to be exact, and where that stops
 *
 * §4 gives `exact` confidence to the anchor lane only, and `admitProvidedSeeds`
 * routes a seed there only when its confidence is in the exact family. A changed
 * path qualifies for exactly one reason: **the caller resolved it**. It named a
 * workspace-relative path, that path is looked up as a canonical `file:` node
 * id, and a lookup that misses is dropped rather than downgraded — so the claim
 * "this node was retrieved because the caller identified it" is true whenever
 * the seed reaches the answer.
 *
 * That reasoning does not extend one step further. A path *derived* from the
 * query, guessed from a basename, or inferred from a label is not something the
 * caller verified, and it must not enter through here: widening this function to
 * accept a derived path would buy recall by making `file_path` mean "probably".
 * Every input to it is a path a caller supplied verbatim, and nothing in this
 * module constructs, completes or fuzzy-matches one.
 *
 * ## No cap lives here
 *
 * The anchor lane admits query anchors, then focus paths, then these — sharing
 * one `laneTopN` rank budget — so a caller who supplies a thousand paths is
 * bounded by the kernel's own cap and reported as `posting_cap`, and can never
 * displace the query's own anchors. A second cap here would be a tuning number
 * outside `ranking-config.ts`.
