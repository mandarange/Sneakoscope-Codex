/**
 * The frozen CRK2 query contract, expressed as types.
 *
 * ADR §3 fixes `QueryPlan`, `CompactCandidate`, `LaneContribution` and
 * `RetrievalLane` field by field; §4 fixes the confidence mapping. Both live
 * here rather than beside the code that uses them because three cards
 * (CG2-07/08/09) and every future consumer must agree on them, and a shape
 * copied into a call site is a shape that drifts.
 *
 * Two properties are encoded structurally rather than left to discipline:
 *
 *   - **Integers only until the API boundary.** Scores decide result order, and
 *     a float score would let the same query rank differently on two machines.
 *     Internal arithmetic is fixed-point `number` (always an integer, always
 *     inside 2^53); `CompactCandidate.score` is the `bigint` the contract names,
 *     converted once at the boundary.
 *   - **A text match can never claim `exact`.** The demotion ladder below has
 *     three rungs, not six, because demoting `exact_definition` to
 *     `exact_reference` would be "one step" that left the candidate inside the
 *     exact family — which is exactly the §4 violation the rule exists to stop.
