/**
 * Compiles a `ContextGraphSnapshot` into the SKSCG2 binary layout.
 *
 * The writer's contract is determinism: the same snapshot must produce
 * byte-identical output, on any machine, in any process. That is what makes the
 * index content-addressable, which is in turn what lets a generation be named
 * by its own hash and swapped in by an atomic rename. Anything that leaks
 * ambient order into the bytes — a `Map` iterated in insertion order, a
 * `Date.now()`, a locale-sensitive sort — breaks that chain silently, so every
 * table here is built from an explicit sort over stable identifiers.
 *
 * The writer is also the last place that can refuse. A snapshot carrying an
 * absolute path or a lint error must not reach the index, because once it is
 * interned into the string table the reader has no way to tell it apart from
 * legitimate workspace content.

 * produce a wrong-typed value from an in-bounds string, and can never decide

 *
 * It is also why the lexicon survives. The interned text is the value's own

 * `kernel`, not as `"kernel"` — so a fixture that seeds a lexicon term through a
 * metadata value still resolves under `termId`. JSON-encoding the value was
