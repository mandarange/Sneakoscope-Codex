/**
 * Freshness for the compact index, established **without reading the JSON
 * snapshot**.
 *
 * `contextGraphStatus()` answers the same question by parsing
 * `context-graph.json` as its first act — 58 MB on the measured baseline, on a
 * path whose whole purpose is to avoid parsing it. That parse was not
 * gratuitous: it is where git-derived staleness comes from, and an index whose
 * sources changed underneath it must not be allowed to answer. Removing the
 * check in favour of pointer/meta integrity alone would produce a workspace
 * that answers from a stale index with **no error at all**, which is a worse
 * outcome than the byte cost — ADR §1 forbids exactly that silent downgrade.
 *
 * So nothing here is relaxed. The snapshot is replaced as an *input*, not as a
 * check:
 *
 * | JSON path reads from the snapshot | this module reads instead |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | the file exists / parses | the index pointer's presence, and the meta |
 * | `snapshotHash`, `nodeCount`, `edgeCount` | the same three fields on the meta |
 * | `schemaRevision` | `meta.schemaRevision`, written from the same constant |
 * | `extractors`, as a fallback identity list | the caller's, or none — see below |
 *
 * Everything after that — `computeContextGraphCacheKey`,
 * `compareCacheKeyParts`, the HEAD-freshness rescue and the recorded-input
 * re-hash — never touched the snapshot in the first place and is reproduced
 * here unchanged, so the two paths agree by construction rather than by
 * intention. `index-freshness.test.ts` runs both against the same workspaces
 * and asserts the verdicts match, because "same verdicts" is a property to
 * check, not a comment to write.
 *
 * ## Failing closed
 *
 * Every branch that cannot establish freshness produces a status with an error
 * code and `CONTEXT_GRAPH_REPAIR_COMMAND`. There is no branch that returns
 * `fresh` because a check could not be run, and no fallback to the previous
 * generation — the ADR forbids one, and a fallback is what makes a correctness
 * floor unprovable.
 *
 * An unexpected IO failure is deliberately **allowed to propagate** rather than
 * being caught and folded into a verdict. A `catch` around this derivation is
 * precisely how a workspace starts reporting `fresh` because a read failed, and
 * no verdict at all is safer than a confident one nobody computed.
